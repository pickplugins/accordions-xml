Since this is an administrative process, the Child Support Recovery Unit (Unit) has the authority to pursue this type of enforcement action without the need for an additional court order. The obligor or joint owner may challenge the administrative levy process administratively through the Unit as well as through the district court.\n\nIowa Code Chapter 252I authorizes the Unit to use an administrative levy to collect delinquent support payments by executing, attaching or placing levies against obligors’ accounts maintained in Iowa financial institutions and in out-of-state financial institutions accepting direct levies from Iowa. Using the interstate referral process, the Unit may also place levies against obligors’ accounts maintained in out-of-state financial institutions not accepting direct levies.\n\nAsset information may be received through several sources, the primary source being the automated financial institution data-match (FIDM). The FIDM process has two parts:\n<ul>\n \t<li>In-state (ISFIDM) matching provides account information from financial institutions within the state of Iowa.</li>\n \t<li>Multi-state (MSFIDM) matching provides account information from financial institutions throughout the United States and its territories.</li>\n</ul>\nAsset information may also be received through contact with the obligee or other interested third party.\n\nThe administrative levy process is semi-centralized.

Challenges allow the obligor/joint owner due process in resolving issues related to the administrative levy placed against the obligor’s/joint owner’s assets.\nThere are two types of challenges to the administrative levy process: administrative and district court. The Unit handles the administrative challenge internally. The outcome of this challenge is decided administratively without court involvement. If the party wishes to challenge the decision of the administrative challenge, the party may file a district court challenge. The district court decides the outcome of this challenge.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Who can submit a challenge?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(1); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b>\n\nA challenge to the administrative levy process must be submitted by or on behalf of the obligor or joint owner. A joint owner is considered to be any person having a direct interest in the asset being levied, whether or not the person received notice of the administrative levy action by the Unit. If the joint owner is a minor, an adult having a direct interest in the minor’s welfare may submit the challenge on the minor’s behalf.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>What is considered a “written” challenge?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(2); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b>\n\nIowa Code requires all challenges to the administrative levy process to be in <b>writing</b>. Consider <b>any</b> written communication from the obligor or joint owner received by the Unit after the issuance of the Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor or Administrative Levy Notice to Joint Owner as a challenge. “Written communication” includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Letter or note.</li>\n \t<li>E-mail.</li>\n \t<li>Fax.</li>\n</ul>\nIf the obligor/joint owner states over the telephone or in person his or her intent to challenge the administrative levy and does <b>not</b> provide a written document to that effect within the specified timeframe, then no challenge is received.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>What are the timeframes for submitting a challenge?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(2); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b>\n\nBoth the administrative and district court challenges must be submitted <b>in writing</b> and <b>received</b> by the Unit within 10 working days of a previous action by the Unit (described below). Iowa Code section 252I.1(10) defines “working days” as “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, but excluding the holidays specified in section 1C.2, subsections 1 through 9.”\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Administrative Challenges</b>\n\n<b>All administrative challenges must be in writing and physically received by the Unit within 10 working days of the date on form 470-3338, Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor, or form 470-3207, Administrative Levy Notice to Joint Owner.</b>\n\nTo determine whether the administrative challenge is timely:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Review the date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field on the ADMLEVY screen.</li>\n \t<li>Review the case narratives for the date the notices were mailed (in case the notices were mailed on a date other than the date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field).</li>\n \t<li>Count 10 days from the day <b>after</b> the date on the form or the date of mailing, whichever is most recent.\n<b>Example:</b> The date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field indicates that you mailed the Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor on Thursday, August 11th. Start counting from Friday, August 12th. The 13th, 14th, 20th and 21st are <b>weekend</b> days and are not counted in the 10 days. To be considered timely, you must receive the challenge on or before August 26th.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Information for challenges to the Administrative Levy process</b>\n\nIf a payor has multiple ICAR cases, all of the payor’s case numbers display on form 470-3338, <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i> and form 470-3208, <i>Notice of Decision Regarding Admin Levy Challenge</i>, <b>even when a case did not qualify for a levy</b>. Sometimes FIs use the case numbers from these forms when sending in the levy payment, causing money to distribute to a case in error.\n\nIf you receive a challenge to an administrative levy (from either the payor or the joint owner) and the payor has multiple ICAR cases, you need to verify which cases qualified for that levy. To verify which of the payor’s cases qualified for that levy, you can:\n<ol type=\"a\">\n \t<li>Use Global 360 to review form 470-3189, <i>Administrative Levy Notice to Financial Institution</i> or form 470-3188, <i>Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor</i>. Both of these forms should display the case numbers that qualified for this levy.</li>\n</ol>\nMake sure you view the forms with the correct FI and the correct date of the levy.\n\n<b>OR</b>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n \t<li>Review the narratives on <b>all</b> of the payor’s ICAR cases to locate the narrative (LEVY 17: CASE HAS MET ADMINISTRATIVE LEVY CRITERIA). This narrative must be dated closely before this FI was added to the case. If a case does not have the narrative (LEVY 17) before this FI was added to the case, the case did not qualify to be levied at that time.</li>\n \t<li>When you have verified which of the payor’s cases qualified for this levy, complete the CHALLENGE FILED DATE field and the corresponding TYPE field (on the ADMINISTRATIVE LEVY screen). ICAR will begin generating the <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i>.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n \t<li>When the form is generating, remove the case numbers that did not qualify for this levy from the ICAR CASE NUMBERS FIELD ON THE FORM VIEW screen. After you edit the case number information, press F3 to update the changes.</li>\n \t<li>Then print the form.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that only the case numbers which qualified for this levy are on the form.</li>\n \t<li>Do this for each copy of the <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i> (for the FI, the payor, and the joint owner).</li>\n \t<li>Image the copies.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n \t<li>After you have held the administrative levy challenge and have entered the information in the N.O.D. TO OBLIGOR &amp; FI (R/U): field (on the ADMINISTRATIVE LEVY screen), ICAR will begin generating the <i>Notice of Decision Regarding Admin Levy Challenge</i>.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n \t<li>When the form is generating, remove the case numbers that did not qualify for this levy from the CASE NUMBERS FIELD on the FORM VIEW screen. After you edit the case number information, press F3 to update the changes.</li>\n \t<li>Then print the form.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that only the case numbers which qualified for this levy are on the form.</li>\n \t<li>Do this for each copy of the Notice of Decision Regarding Admin Levy Challenge (for the FI, the payor, and the joint owner).</li>\n \t<li>Image the copies.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Reviewing the Facts of a Challenge</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(3); 441 IAC 98.97(1)</b>\n\nIowa law requires you to contact the challenging party to discuss the facts of the challenge when you receive a timely challenge. The challenging party has a right to a review of the facts of the case prior to you determining the outcome of the challenge and sending the Notice of Decision Regarding Administrative Levy Challenge.\n\n<b>When you receive a challenge that is not timely, still review the basis for the challenge to determine whether the Unit has made a mistake of fact. This is especially important when the challenge involves jointly held assets.</b>\n\nWhen you receive an <b>un-timely</b> challenge that involves jointly held assets, treat the challenge as if it were timely and proceed with contacting the challenging party to schedule a conference to review the facts of the case.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>What is a “Mistake of Fact”?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(3); 441 IAC 98.97(1)</b>\n\nThe determination of whether you uphold or release an administrative levy is based on the challenging party’s ability to prove the Unit made a “mistake of fact” regarding the levy. The definition of “mistake of fact” is based in <b>law</b>.\n\nAs defined in Iowa Code and the Iowa Administrative Code, a “<b>mistake of fact</b>” is a mistake <b><i>including but not limited to</i></b>, a mistake in the identity of the obligor or a mistake in the amount of delinquent support due; policy further extends this definition to a mistake in the amount of the asset or a mistake in the information reported to the Unit by the financial institution. The language “<b>including but not limited to</b>” means that <b>any</b> reason pertaining directly to the levy, above-stated or otherwise, the party provides as the basis for the challenge <b>must</b> be accepted as a <b>mistake of fact</b>. Until disproved by the Unit, you <b>cannot</b> deny a challenge because the challenge does not meet one of the specific above-named criteria.\n\nWhen you receive a challenge (whether or not it is timely) from a joint owner or involving a jointly-held asset, <b>accept the challenge</b> and ask the challenging party to provide verification of whose funds are deposited in the account. This information helps you determine whether to uphold or release the levy.\n\nSupervisory approval is required to release an administrative levy for any reason other than a mistake in identity, incorrect delinquency, or overpayment of balance.

The obligor has cited a <b>mistake of fact</b>, as the account does not really belong to the obligor.<b>Action:</b>\nSchedule a conference with the obligor to discuss the issues related to the levy. During the conference, the obligor states the daughter is saving her babysitting money to buy a new bicycle. Request the obligor provide proof of the deposits/withdrawals.\n<b>Outcome:</b>\nIf the only deposits/withdrawals are those made by or on behalf of the daughter, <b>release</b> the levy.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n \t<li>You receive an un-timely challenge from the joint owner. The joint owner is the obligor’s elderly mother. The challenge states that the obligor’s mother placed the obligor’s name on her account for when she passes away. The joint owner has cited a <b>mistake of fact</b>, as the account does not really belong to the obligor.<b>Action:</b>\nSchedule a conference with the joint owner to discuss the issues related to the levy. During the conference, the obligor’s mother states the obligor has no knowledge of the account and has not made any deposits to or withdrawals from the account.

If possible, try to resolve the challenge issues pro-actively and avoid the necessity of a conference. If the obligor/joint owner calls you ensure that the case selection criteria are correct and that the asset can be levied.\n\nThe challenge process begins when the obligor/joint owner <b>actually submits a written challenge</b>. Do not notify the financial institution of a challenge after a telephone conversation or a walk-in conversation unless the person actually submits a <b>written</b> challenge to the Unit. If the person takes the written challenge with him/her, the challenge is not actually submitted to the Unit.\n\n<b>Example:</b>\n\nThe obligor requests a telephone call from you. You call the obligor and answer the obligor’s questions about the administrative levy. Specifically remind the obligor that any challenge has to be in writing and received by the Unit within 10 working days. Narrate this reminder and do <b>not</b> generate form 470-3338, <i>Notice of Challenge to Administrative Levy</i>, to the financial institution, or form 470-3208, <i>Notice of Decision Regarding Administrative Levy Challenge</i>, to the obligor/joint owner.\";i:1582231562545;s:2706:\"<b>Questions from the Obligor/Joint Owner</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> What authority do you have to levy my accounts?\n<b>A.</b> Iowa Code, <a href=\"http://search.legis.state.ia.us/nxt/gateway.dll/ic?f=templates&amp;fn=default.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chapter 252I</a>.\n\n<b>Q.</b> How did you find out where I bank?\n<b>A.</b> Through automated sources or other confidential sources.\n\n<b>Q.</b> If I change financial institutions, will you be able to find my account?\n<b>A.</b> Yes.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Do you care if I need the money for living expenses?\n<b>A.</b> We will only take up to 50% of the account. The remaining balance is available for your use.\n\n<b>Q.</b> How often can you levy my account?\n<b>A.</b> As often as your case meets the criteria.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can I close the account?\n<b>A.</b> Not until the money is taken.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can I write checks on the account?\n<b>A.</b> Yes, you may write checks on any balance remaining after the financial institution freezes up to 50% of your accounts.\n\n<b>Q.</b> My notice says you won’t take the money for 15-20 days, but the financial institution already took it.\n<b>A.</b> The financial institution immediately freezes up to 50% of the funds in the account, and does not remit the funds until the 15- to 20-day timeframe is up. This allows time for you to challenge the levy.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can I enter into a payment agreement to avoid or stop the administrative levy?\n<b>A.</b> An administrative payment agreement does not stop a levy already in progress.

However, when the obligor makes a REG payment in direct response to an administrative levy action, it is important to count the payment as a levy or \"LVY\" payment. This is because the funds available to pay the Iowa financial institutions for the FIDM asset information are based on the state\'s share of the PA levy collections.\n\nWhen you receive a REG payment from an obligor as a result of administrative levy notification, mark the payment as an <i>administrative levy</i> payment and forward it to CSC. This allows CSC to credit the payment to the administrative levy process.\n\nIf a levy payment is already on ICAR with a fund source \"REG\", CSC will no longer change the fund source from \"REG to \"LVY\".\";i:1582231564304;s:1634:\"When you receive form 470-3170, <i>Asset Verification Request</i>, from the financial institution:\n\n<b>Active Accounts:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Locate the corresponding ASSET screen on ICAR.</li>\n \t<li>Enter a “Y” in the assets verified field.</li>\n \t<li>Update the information about the account number (acct nbr), amount (amt), account type (acct. type) and joint owner (joint) as needed.</li>\n \t<li>Press F3 twice to update the screen.

If a levy was previously generated and processed on a TSP account, payments will be reviewed to see if CSRU has received the payment from the previous TSP levy. If the TSP levy payment has applied to the ICAR case, the TSP Levy Team will generate and process a new levy. If no TSP levy payment has applied, the TSP Levy Team will not fax a new levy to TSP at this time and will monitor the case for the incoming TSP levy payment.

The FIDM process has two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In-state (ISFIDM) matching provides account information from financial institutions within the state of Iowa.</li>\n<li>Multi-state (MSFIDM) matching provides account information from financial institutions throughout the United States and its territories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asset information may also be received through contact with the obligee or other interested third party.</p>\n<p>The administrative levy process is semi-centralized. EPICS staff handles the identification of assets, review of asset information, the initiation of administrative levies and monitoring cases for payment.

Challenges allow the obligor/joint owner due process in resolving issues related to the administrative levy placed against the obligor’s/joint owner’s assets.<br />\nThere are two types of challenges to the administrative levy process: administrative and district court. The Unit handles the administrative challenge internally. The outcome of this challenge is decided administratively without court involvement. If the party wishes to challenge the decision of the administrative challenge, the party may file a district court challenge. The district court decides the outcome of this challenge.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Who can submit a challenge?</b></p>\n<p><b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(1); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b></p>\n<p>A challenge to the administrative levy process must be submitted by or on behalf of the obligor or joint owner. A joint owner is considered to be any person having a direct interest in the asset being levied, whether or not the person received notice of the administrative levy action by the Unit. If the joint owner is a minor, an adult having a direct interest in the minor’s welfare may submit the challenge on the minor’s behalf.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>What is considered a “written” challenge?</b></p>\n<p><b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(2); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b></p>\n<p>Iowa Code requires all challenges to the administrative levy process to be in <b>writing</b>. Consider <b>any</b> written communication from the obligor or joint owner received by the Unit after the issuance of the Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor or Administrative Levy Notice to Joint Owner as a challenge. “Written communication” includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Letter or note.</li>\n<li>E-mail.</li>\n<li>Fax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the obligor/joint owner states over the telephone or in person his or her intent to challenge the administrative levy and does <b>not</b> provide a written document to that effect within the specified timeframe, then no challenge is received.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>What are the timeframes for submitting a challenge?</b></p>\n<p><b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(2); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b></p>\n<p>Both the administrative and district court challenges must be submitted <b>in writing</b> and <b>received</b> by the Unit within 10 working days of a previous action by the Unit (described below). Iowa Code section 252I.1(10) defines “working days” as “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, but excluding the holidays specified in section 1C.2, subsections 1 through 9.”</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Administrative Challenges</b></p>\n<p><b>All administrative challenges must be in writing and physically received by the Unit within 10 working days of the date on form 470-3338, Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor, or form 470-3207, Administrative Levy Notice to Joint Owner.</b></p>\n<p>To determine whether the administrative challenge is timely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Review the date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field on the ADMLEVY screen.</li>\n<li>Review the case narratives for the date the notices were mailed (in case the notices were mailed on a date other than the date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field).</li>\n<li>Count 10 days from the day <b>after</b> the date on the form or the date of mailing, whichever is most recent.<br />\n<b>Example:</b> The date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field indicates that you mailed the Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor on Thursday, August 11th. Start counting from Friday, August 12th. The 13th, 14th, 20th and 21st are <b>weekend</b> days and are not counted in the 10 days. To be considered timely, you must receive the challenge on or before August 26th.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Information for challenges to the Administrative Levy process</b></p>\n<p>If a payor has multiple ICAR cases, all of the payor’s case numbers display on form 470-3338, <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i> and form 470-3208, <i>Notice of Decision Regarding Admin Levy Challenge</i>, <b>even when a case did not qualify for a levy</b>. Sometimes FIs use the case numbers from these forms when sending in the levy payment, causing money to distribute to a case in error.</p>\n<p>If you receive a challenge to an administrative levy (from either the payor or the joint owner) and the payor has multiple ICAR cases, you need to verify which cases qualified for that levy. To verify which of the payor’s cases qualified for that levy, you can:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Use Global 360 to review form 470-3189, <i>Administrative Levy Notice to Financial Institution</i> or form 470-3188, <i>Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor</i>.

This narrative must be dated closely before this FI was added to the case. If a case does not have the narrative (LEVY 17) before this FI was added to the case, the case did not qualify to be levied at that time.</li>\n<li>When you have verified which of the payor’s cases qualified for this levy, complete the CHALLENGE FILED DATE field and the corresponding TYPE field (on the ADMINISTRATIVE LEVY screen). ICAR will begin generating the <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i>.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>When the form is generating, remove the case numbers that did not qualify for this levy from the ICAR CASE NUMBERS FIELD ON THE FORM VIEW screen. After you edit the case number information, press F3 to update the changes.</li>\n<li>Then print the form.</li>\n<li>Verify that only the case numbers which qualified for this levy are on the form.</li>\n<li>Do this for each copy of the <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i> (for the FI, the payor, and the joint owner).</li>\n<li>Image the copies.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>After you have held the administrative levy challenge and have entered the information in the N.O.D.

The challenging party has a right to a review of the facts of the case prior to you determining the outcome of the challenge and sending the Notice of Decision Regarding Administrative Levy Challenge.</p>\n<p><b>When you receive a challenge that is not timely, still review the basis for the challenge to determine whether the Unit has made a mistake of fact. This is especially important when the challenge involves jointly held assets.</b></p>\n<p>When you receive an <b>un-timely</b> challenge that involves jointly held assets, treat the challenge as if it were timely and proceed with contacting the challenging party to schedule a conference to review the facts of the case.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>What is a “Mistake of Fact”?</b></p>\n<p><b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(3); 441 IAC 98.97(1)</b></p>\n<p>The determination of whether you uphold or release an administrative levy is based on the challenging party’s ability to prove the Unit made a “mistake of fact” regarding the levy. The definition of “mistake of fact” is based in <b>law</b>.</p>\n<p>As defined in Iowa Code and the Iowa Administrative Code, a “<b>mistake of fact</b>” is a mistake <b><i>including but not limited to</i></b>, a mistake in the identity of the obligor or a mistake in the amount of delinquent support due; policy further extends this definition to a mistake in the amount of the asset or a mistake in the information reported to the Unit by the financial institution. The language “<b>including but not limited to</b>” means that <b>any</b> reason pertaining directly to the levy, above-stated or otherwise, the party provides as the basis for the challenge <b>must</b> be accepted as a <b>mistake of fact</b>. Until disproved by the Unit, you <b>cannot</b> deny a challenge because the challenge does not meet one of the specific above-named criteria.</p>\n<p>When you receive a challenge (whether or not it is timely) from a joint owner or involving a jointly-held asset, <b>accept the challenge</b> and ask the challenging party to provide verification of whose funds are deposited in the account. This information helps you determine whether to uphold or release the levy.</p>\n<p>Supervisory approval is required to release an administrative levy for any reason other than a mistake in identity, incorrect delinquency, or overpayment of balance.

The obligor has cited a <b>mistake of fact</b>, as the account does not really belong to the obligor.<b>Action:</b><br />\nSchedule a conference with the obligor to discuss the issues related to the levy. During the conference, the obligor states the daughter is saving her babysitting money to buy a new bicycle. Request the obligor provide proof of the deposits/withdrawals.<br />\n<b>Outcome:</b><br />\nIf the only deposits/withdrawals are those made by or on behalf of the daughter, <b>release</b> the levy.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>You receive an un-timely challenge from the joint owner. The joint owner is the obligor’s elderly mother. The challenge states that the obligor’s mother placed the obligor’s name on her account for when she passes away. The joint owner has cited a <b>mistake of fact</b>, as the account does not really belong to the obligor.<b>Action:</b><br />\nSchedule a conference with the joint owner to discuss the issues related to the levy. During the conference, the obligor’s mother states the obligor has no knowledge of the account and has not made any deposits to or withdrawals from the account.

If possible, try to resolve the challenge issues pro-actively and avoid the necessity of a conference. If the obligor/joint owner calls you ensure that the case selection criteria are correct and that the asset can be levied.</p>\n<p>The challenge process begins when the obligor/joint owner <b>actually submits a written challenge</b>. Do not notify the financial institution of a challenge after a telephone conversation or a walk-in conversation unless the person actually submits a <b>written</b> challenge to the Unit. If the person takes the written challenge with him/her, the challenge is not actually submitted to the Unit.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>The obligor requests a telephone call from you. You call the obligor and answer the obligor’s questions about the administrative levy. Specifically remind the obligor that any challenge has to be in writing and received by the Unit within 10 working days.

If a release or revision is needed, the TSP Levy Team will issue one with the forms that are specific to the TSP levies.</p>\n<p><b>Q.</b> What is the timeline for the TSP Levy process?<br />\n<b>A.</b> The TSP processes a levy in four steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As soon as possible after TSP receives an order to withhold, the payor’s account will be “frozen.”</li>\n<li>TSP will then evaluate the documents to ensure completeness. If it is not complete, TSP will send a written request for complete documents. TSP will remove the freeze if a complete copy is not received within 30 days of TSP’s written request.</li>\n<li>When TSP receives a complete order to withhold, TSP will evaluate it to determine whether it is a qualifying levy.</li>\n<li>TSP will mail a decision letter to the payor and provide a copy to all other parties having an interest in the action. The decision letter will describe the effect the levy will have on the payor’s account and state when the freeze will be removed from the account. If the levy does not qualify, the decision letter will explain why. If the levy qualifies and requires a payment from TSP, the letter will also explain how the payment amount will be calculated and when the payment will be made.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The timeframes in a TSP levy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After TSP receives the levy form, it may take <span style=\"color: red;\">30-60 days</span> to review it and generate a decision letter. (See steps 1-4 above.)</li>\n<li>The payment date will generally be set 30 calendar days from the date of the decision letter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a TSP account was frozen upon receipt of an order to withhold, the freeze will be removed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>upon receipt of an order removing the freeze,</li>\n<li>after payment pursuant to a qualifying order to deliver, or</li>\n<li>as soon as possible, after TSP informs the parties in writing that the document is not a qualifying levy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Q.</b> Will CSRU levy a TSP account more than once?<br />\n<b>A.</b> The TSP Levy Team will generate and process a levy for any ICAR case that meets the administrative levy criteria. However, because a levy on a TSP account can take a minimum of <span style=\"color: red;\">3 – 4 months</span> to complete, there may be a circumstance where the TSP account has re-matched the same ICAR case before CSRU has received the payment from the previous TSP levy.</p>\n<p>The TSP Levy Team reviews the ICAR case for previous TSP levies. If a levy was previously generated and processed on a TSP account, payments will be reviewed to see if CSRU has received the payment from the previous TSP levy. If the TSP levy payment has applied to the ICAR case, the TSP Levy Team will generate and process a new levy. If no TSP levy payment has applied, the TSP Levy Team will not fax a new levy to TSP at this time and will monitor the case for the incoming TSP levy payment. After the TSP levy payment applies, if the case still meets the criteria for an administrative levy, a new levy will be generated and processed.</p>\";s:4:\"hide\";s:5:\"false\";}i:1585679539089;a:3:{s:6:\"header\";s:17:\"Verifying Assets \";s:4:\"body\";s:3058:\" <p>Identification of an asset is the very first step in the administrative levy process.

The process provides the payor with many opportunities to pay the support owed and avoid the loss of licenses. At various points in the process, the payor may request a conference with CSRU to enter into a payment agreement or to provide verification of a qualifying exemption from the process.\n\nIf the payor is unable to resolve the situation administratively with CSRU, the payor may request a district court hearing.\n\nThe LISAN process is centralized at EPICS, effective July 7, 2014.\n\nEPICS staff complete all actions/steps in the process except for:\n<ul>\n \t<li>In-Person Conferences</li>\n \t<li>District Court hearings</li>\n</ul>\nEPICS staff are assigned to caseloads by an alpha split.

The payor will no longer have the option for an AEC agreement in lieu of LISAN.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Payments Received at CSRU - Checking CASESTAT</b>\n\n<b>CSRU</b> staff accepting payments at the customer window review CASESTAT for an open LISAN or CONTEMPT screen. The appropriate/assigned worker (if different than the person receiving the payment) is notified.

Urgent referrals are worked the same day. This may avoid a sanction with the licensing agency(s).\n\nCSRU may wish to post a notice at the customer window asking customers to tell staff if a payment is for a license sanction, contempt or administrative levy action.

The program reviews only the previous month\'\'s payments to determine whether the payor is in compliance with the payment agreement.\n\nEPICS reviews for payments received between issuance of the flag and review of the case. The <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i> is issued when appropriate.\n\n<b>Calculating the \'\'Lifetime\'\' of the Payment Agreement</b>\n\nWhen a license sanction (LISAN) payment agreement is entered on a case, ICAR begins monitoring cases for incoming payments. One of the payment monitoring calculations is referred to as a \'\'lifetime\'\' payment agreement calculation.\n\nICAR calculates how <b>much is due</b> under the \'\'lifetime\'\' of the LISAN payment agreement by:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Counting the number of months due from the date in the START field through the end of the most recent month (ICAR converts the frequency to monthly if any other frequency is entered.), and</li>\n \t<li>Multiplying the payment agreement amount by the number of months the payment agreement has been due, and</li>\n \t<li>ICAR reviews the REG payments received during that same lifetime of the payment agreement. ICAR then compares the amount due to the amount paid for the lifetime of the payment agreement.</li>\n \t<li>If the amount paid is greater than the amount due and there\'\'s a sanction in place ICAR, issues calendar flag: LISAN 28 and narrative Lisan 54 to the EPICS worker for that case.</li>\n</ol>\nThe EPICS worker reviews the case and issues a <i>Notice Of Withdrawal Of Certificate Of Noncompliance</i> 470-3275 if appropriate, and adds a narrative to the case which includes the \'\'lifetime\'\' payment agreement calculation. (Examples of ICAR\'\'s calculation are below.)\n\nThe \'\'lifetime\'\' LISAN payment agreement monitoring/calculation program does not include MIW, IWO, or UIB payments received. If a MIW, IWO, or UIB payment is received in a month, <b>that month will be excluded</b> from the \'\'lifetime\'\' calculations for payments due and for payments received. (This is <b>only</b> for the calculations of the lifetime payment agreement.)\n\n<b>Example 1:</b> A case has a LISAN payment agreement for $10/month starting 05/01/2013 and ending 09/30/2013.\n\n[ninja_tables id=\"932\"]\n\nThe $50 MIW payment (received in 07/2013) will not be added to the LISAN payments \"received\" calculation and will not be added to the payment \"due\" calculation for the same month (07/2013). ICAR will calculate the totals for the lifetime of the payment agreement above as: Payments Due = $40, Payments Received = $20.\n\n<b>Example 2:</b> A case has a LISAN payment agreement for $10/month starting 05/01/2013 and ending 09/30/2013.\n\n[ninja_tables id=\"933\"]\n\nThe totals calculated for the lifetime of the payment agreement above will be: Payments Due = $40, Payments Received = $20.\n\nThis payor made a REG payment in the same month as the MIW payment. Since, that month is excluded from payments due; all payments received in that month are excluded (the REG payment is also excluded).\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Length of the Payment Agreement</b>\n\nSee <a href=\"http://dhs.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/11-g.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/pdf.png\" /> Title 11-G</b></a>, <b>Results of License Sanction Conference, <i>Length of the Payment Agreement</i> When a signed payment agreement exceeds one year:</b>\n\nICAR issues calendar flag LISAN19.\n\nLISAN payment agreement signed one year ago.

All sanctions and withdrawals are processed electronically through ICAR.</li>\n \t<li><b>Department of Natural Resources (DNR)</b> -- FAX forms to DNR; do not send through regular mail.

Do not send forms through regular mail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Contempt</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> If the obligor has two cases with court orders filed in the same county/judicial district, one referred for license sanction and the other for contempt, do I proceed with the license sanction for the case not referred for contempt?\n<b>A.</b> In general, to prevent the risk of double-jeopardy, it is advisable <i>not</i> to proceed with the license sanction; however, if the contempt hearing has <i>not</i> been set, you may retract the contempt referral and proceed with the license sanction, if appropriate.\n\nIf the contempt hearing <i>has</i> been set, discuss the case with your unit attorney as to how to proceed.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can I proceed with a license sanction and contempt at the same time?\n<b>A.</b> No. Per Iowa Administrative Code*, contempt is an exemption from the license sanction process. You must withdraw the <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i> (if issued) and process-end the LISAN screen before proceeding with a contempt action.\n\n*IAC 441- 98.102(6) <i>Contempt process</i>. Involvement in a contempt action dealing with support issues is considered a valid reason for exemption from the license sanction process during the pendency of the contempt action.\n\n<b>Q.</b> The obligor does not have a valid license or vehicle registration. Do I have to wait 90 days after we stop the license sanction process before pursuing a contempt action?\n<b>A.</b> You may end the license sanction process if you determine that the obligor no longer has any valid licenses or vehicle registrations. You may then consult with your office attorney for a possible contempt referral.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can I pursue a license sanction and contempt on an obligor who has multiple cases in two different offices?\n<b>A.</b> You may pursue license sanction and contempt on an obligor with multiple cases in two different offices. The cases must have different court orders and you may not pursue both actions on the same case.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>District Court Hearing</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> If the obligor requests a district court hearing, should I issue the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>?\n<b>A.</b> No, do not issue the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>. The clerk of court will inform the licensing agency that a court hearing has been requested. The licensing agency will then take the appropriate steps in regards to the sanction.\n\n<b>Q.</b> What if the obligor requests a district court hearing at the time of the license sanction conference and the Certificate of Noncompliance has not been issued? What should I do?\n<b>A.</b> Consult with your office attorney. The attorney may wish to file a resistance.\n\n<b>Q.</b> What if the obligor sends a written request for a district court hearing to the local office? Should I forward the request to the clerk of court\'\'s office?\n<b>A.</b> The payor must file a request for hearing with the clerk of court. If the payor sends a request directly to CSRU, contact the payor and explain he/she must file the request for hearing with the clerk of court in the county where the order is filed.\n\nIf EPICS receives a request for hearing directly from the payor, send an email to the CSRUOffice Mailbox with a \"cc\" to the supervisor advising of the request for hearing. CSRU will follow-up by contacting the payor (see also: <a href=\"http://dhssp/csr/Central/epics/LISAN%20BPH/34-District%20Court%20Hearing.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/sharepoint.png\" /> District Court Hearing</b></a>)\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Driver\'\'s Licenses</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> The obligor\'\'s driver\'\'s license is currently barred and there is no matching vehicle registration. What purpose does it serve to sanction the obligor\'\'s license for child support?\n<b>A.</b> According to DOT, you should not be concerned with what other sanctions an obligor has on his or her driving record. The other sanction may be lifted at any time. In order for the child support sanction to become effective, the sanction needs to be on the record at the time the other sanction is lifted. Although there is no guarantee that the obligor will ever again be eligible to receive an Iowa driver\'\'s license, there is no harm in placing the sanction.\n\n<b>Q.</b>The obligor\'\'s Iowa driver\'\'s license is still valid and the obligor has moved to another state. Should I still sanction the license?\n<b>A.</b> A driver\'\'s license \"stop\" entered in Iowa is placed on a national database which other states <i>may</i> access prior to issuing a driver\'\'s license. According to DOT, it is <i>assumed</i> that states would not issue a driver\'\'s license to a person if the person had sanctions in another state; however, each state has its own exceptions to that assumption. Again, while there is no guarantee that a child support sanction in Iowa will prevent an obligor from obtaining a driver\'\'s license in another state, there is no harm in placing the sanction.\n\n<b>Q.</b> What does Ã¢â‚¬Å“OTHÃ¢â‚¬Â mean as an entry on DLIC in the non-cdl stat field?\n<b>A.</b> According to DOT it means that a prior sanction has been lifted. The obligor does not have a valid license at this time, and the obligor is eligible for a license should the obligor apply.\n\n<b>Q.</b> What does it mean when the cdl-status and non-cdl stat fields on DLIC are blank, and the license is not listed as a class Ã¢â‚¬Å“0Ã¢â‚¬Â (ID-only)?\n<b>A.</b> It could mean that it is an Ã¢â‚¬Å“NDLÃ¢â‚¬Â (no driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license) record. This means that the court has issued a ticket or fine and the person did not have a driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license at the time. DOT issues the NDL record so that if the person attempts to obtain a driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license at a later date, DOT will be aware that there is a fine or ticket that needs to be paid.\n\n<b>Q.</b> The obligor was in the office today and paid his/her delinquency. I issued the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i> to DOT. Can I give the obligor a copy of the withdrawal to take with him/her directly to the DOT office?\n<b>A.</b> You may provide the obligor a copy of the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>; however, the obligor may <i>not</i> take the withdrawal directly to the DOT office to obtain his/her driver\'\'s license. The reason this is not possible is due to DOT\'\'s requirements for reinstating a driver\'\'s license.\n\nWhen you generate the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>, ICAR sends an electronic withdrawal transaction to DOT\'\'s computer system. DOT\'\'s system processes this transaction that same night though a batch program. When the sanction is removed from DOT\'\'s system, DOT generates a \"lift notice\" to the obligor explaining that the sanction is lifted and the obligor may now obtain his/her driver\'\'s license. DOT\'\'s system does not generate the lift notice until the <i>following</i> day after the withdrawal transaction is processed. Once the lift notice generates, the notice is available online to DOT before it is mailed.\n\nDOT will not reinstate a license for an obligor without the obligor having his/her DOT lift notice in-hand. This means that the obligor must wait until he/she receives the lift notice in the mail before attempting to obtain his/her license at a DOT office. DOT has confirmed that if an obligor has obtained a withdrawal and does not have a copy of the lift notice, and the lift notice is available to DOT online, DOT will print the lift notice for the obligor and reinstate the obligor\'\'s license.\n\nTherefore, it is important to emphasize to the obligor that even thought he/she has obtained a withdrawal from CSRU, the obligor must wait until he/she receives notice from DOT regarding reinstatement of the driver\'\'s license before attempting to obtain his/her license at a DOT office.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Exemptions</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> For an obligor to enter vocational rehab, the obligor must prove that he/she has a disability. If I determine that the obligor is in vocational rehab, do I still need a <i>Physician\'\'s Statement</i> as proof of disability?\n<b>A.</b> Yes, you should still obtain a <i>Physician\'\'s Statement</i> from the obligor.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Social security retirement is considered an exemption from the license sanction process. Should I link SSA to the IWO and process-end the LISAN screen if I verify the obligor is receiving social security retirement benefits?\n<b>A.</b> Link SSA to the IWO and enter a Ã¢â‚¬Å“YÃ¢â‚¬Â in the ssr field on the FEDBEN screen if not already entered. This will prevent the case from selecting for license sanction. You may then process-end the LISAN screen.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Forms</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> When generating license sanction forms through the FORMVIEW screen, can I replace the system-entered phone number with my direct phone number?\n<b>A.</b> Yes. You may enter your direct phone number over the existing phone number in the CSRU TELEPHONE NUMBER field on the FORMVIEW screen and update the form. After ICAR generates the form, narrate that you provided the obligor with your direct phone number.\n\n<b>Q.</b>The obligor has multiple cases and the IWO payments are split between the cases. Due to the split, the IWO payments being received on the case are lower than the IWO amount. These payments are also lower than the payment agreement amount. Does the obligor need to make up the difference between the IWO payments and the payment agreement amount?\n<b>A.</b> No. The obligor does not need to make up any difference between the IWO amounts and the payment agreement amount.\n\n<b>Q.</b> The obligor has multiple cases and all of the IWO payments are being paid toward current support on another of the obligor\'\'s cases. Can I send a <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i> since no payments are being received on the case with the license sanction payment agreement?\n<b>A.</b> No. Payments are being received from the income provider and are being split according to IWODIST. Do <i>not</i> send the <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i> when IWO payments are being received from the income provider on at least one of the obligor\'\'s cases.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Should I proceed with a license sanction when an IWO has been sent to a temp agency?\n<b>A.</b> Call the temp agency to verify if the obligor will be given any assignments. If the answer is no, unlink the temp agency from the IWO so that the case may select for license sanction.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Levy</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can I proceed with a license sanction and an administrative levy at the same time?\n<b>A.</b> Yes. A license sanction can be initiated when there is a pending administrative levy. However, if the obligor has signed a payment agreement and is in compliance with the payment agreement, proceed with caution before a new administrative levy is initiated. Verify the balance of the account(s) and discuss the case circumstances with your supervisor.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>License Sanction Conference</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can an obligor request another conference, even after a conference has been rescheduled (2nd conference) and held?\n<b>A.</b> You cannot deny the obligor\'\'s request for a conference. If the obligor fails to attend a rescheduled conference, issue the <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i> (if not previously issued). If the obligor requests another conference, grant the request and schedule another conference.\n\n<b>Q.</b> If form 470-3274, <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i>, is issued because the obligor is not in compliance with the license sanction payment agreement, can the obligor request a conference?\n<b>A.</b> If the payor has already had a license sanction conference and has an existing License Sanction Payment Agreement, the payor will not be given another license sanction conference. The payor must make up all missed payments from the License Sanction Payment Agreement, pay all past-due support, or apply for a district court hearing.\n\n<b>Q.</b> The obligor has two cases in two different offices. The obligor requests a conference with one office, but lives closer to the other office. Which office should handle the conference?\n<b>A.</b> Ask the obligor at which office the obligor would like to have the conference. The obligor must make the decision as to where he/she would like the conference to be held. See PIF <a href=\"file://hoovr3s2/csru.772/CSTMWRK/PITCREWS/SPECENF/PIFS/Resolved/License%20Sanction/2003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/folder.png\" /> LS02-03</b></a> revised for more information.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>License Sanction Criteria</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> Is a current child support obligation required to proceed with a license sanction?\n<b>A.</b> No. A current child support obligation is not required to proceed.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can a license sanction be pursued on a case where the current support obligation has not been ended but there is currently a suspension of current support in place?\n<b>A.</b> Verify there is <i>not</i> a \"C\" (current) or \"F\" (future) in the S (SUSPENSE) field for the obligation on the OBLIGHST screen. When the entry is \"C\" or \"F\", and the child is residing with the obligor, carefully review the case circumstances and schedule an administrative enforcement conference before proceeding to the next step. Consult with your supervisor if you think a conference is not appropriate. Do <i>not</i> proceed with a license sanction action without supervisory approval.\n\n<b>Q.</b> I think I have a good case for license sanction but no LISAN screen has been built. What do I do?\n<b>A.</b> ICAR only builds a LISAN screen when a case meets license sanction criteria, and the obligor matches with a license.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Process - Ending a License Sanction</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can the obligee request the license sanction be ended? There is no danger to the obligee or the children; the obligee just doesn’t feel it is a good time to proceed.\n<b>A.</b> If CSRU is providing enforcement, the license sanction cannot be ended because of the obligee\'\'s request.\n\n<b>Q.</b> If a license sanction was initiated and then the child emancipates causing the current support obligation to end, should the license sanction be ended?\n<b>A.</b> A current support obligation is no longer required for the license sanction process. Continue with the license sanction process until the support owed or some other criteria for ending the process is met.\n\n<b>Q.</b> If a license sanction is active and a notice of bankruptcy is received, should the license sanction process be ended?\n<b>A.</b> If you receive notice of ANY bankruptcy action, issue form 470-3275, <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>, to the licensing agency. Because a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is of short duration and due to the possibility of sanctions against CSRU, it is recommended that you wait until the plan is dismissed or discharged before continuing license sanction proceedings. For more information on bankruptcy, see <a href=\"http://dhs.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/11-G.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/pdf.png\" /> EM 11-G, License Sanction</b></a>.\n\n<b>Q.</b> If at least six months have passed since the <i>Official Notice of Potential License Sanction</i> was mailed/served, when should I process-end the LISAN screen?\n<b>A.</b> Process-end the LISAN screen when:\n<ul>\n \t<li>At least six months have passed since you sent form 470-3278, <i>Official Notice of Potential License Sanction</i>,</li>\n \t<li>The payment agreement is not signed, and</li>\n \t<li>The obligor is not sanctioned.</li>\n</ul>\nExample:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Jan 04 - You send the <i>Official Notice of Potential License Sanction</i>.</li>\n \t<li>Feb 04 - The obligor <i>does not sign</i> a proposed payment agreement for $50 per month.</li>\n \t<li>Mar 04 - The obligor begins making payments of $50 per month.</li>\n \t<li>Apr 04 - Payment for $50 is credited.</li>\n \t<li>May 04 - Payment for $50 is credited.</li>\n \t<li>June 04 - Payment for $50 is credited.</li>\n \t<li>July 04 - Payment for $50 is credited.</li>\n \t<li>Aug 04 - The obligor stops making payments.</li>\n</ul>\nNo payment is received in August. Because at least six months have passed since the <i>Official Notice of Potential License Sanction</i> was mailed/served, process-end the LISAN screen with the code Ã¢â‚¬Å“OTHÃ¢â‚¬Â. Wait for ICAR to again select the case for license sanction and reinitiate the license sanction process. If it has been six months since the <i>Official Notice of Potential License Sanction</i> was mailed/served, we need to again mail it to/serve it on the obligor. This reduces the likelihood of the obligor believing we have waived our intent to proceed with a license sanction.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>REG Payments</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> When a case is receiving REG payments and they are below the obligation level, may I pursue license sanction?\n<b>A.</b> When the obligor is making REG payments and the payments are not equal to or greater than the obligation amount for three months, ICAR selects the case for license sanction as long as the case meets all other license sanction criteria. However, if the obligor is making consistent payments and those payments are below the obligation level, you may want to consult with your supervisor before proceeding with a license sanction.\n\n<b>Q.</b> I received LISAN calendar flag (LISAN 33) starting the obligor has made REG payments equal to or greater than the obligation amount for the last three months (this may be several payments or could be a single, large payment) and to send the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>. Should I send the withdrawal even though the obligor has not signed a payment agreement, paid the support owed, or provided proof of a valid exemption?\n<b>A.</b> Review the case circumstances. You may want to call the obligor and encourage the obligor to sign a payment agreement. Issue the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i> when you and your supervisor feel it is appropriate.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Service of the Obligor</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can the obligor be served with the <i>Official Notice of Potential License Sanction</i> if the obligor comes to the local office? If the obligor is served at the local office, should the obligor sign a waiver of personal service?\n<b>A.</b> Yes, the obligor may be served if the obligor comes to the local office. The obligor should sign a waiver of personal service so there is no question that the obligor was served.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Updating the LISAN screen</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> I made separate entries in multiple fields on the LISAN screen and pressed F3 twice to update the screen. ICAR did not issue/delete the corresponding calendar flags and narratives. Why?&lt;/br /&gt;\n<b>A.</b> When you enter data in multiple non-related fields, you must press F3 twice after each separate entry. This ensures ICAR processes the entries correctly and issues/deletes all related narratives and calendar flags.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Vehicle Registration</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> Can I prevent an obligor from renewing the registration on a leased vehicle?\n<b>A.</b> You cannot place a vehicle registration sanction on a leased vehicle because the leasing company, not the obligor, owns it.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> If the payor has a LISAN payment agreement, is currently sanctioned, and wants to regain his/her licenses and/or vehicle registrations, what must the payor do before I can issue the <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>?\n<b>A.</b> The payor needs to pay all payments that were missed since the LISAN payment agreement start date.\n\nExample: The license sanction payment agreement is $75/month. The IWO is $100/month.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Jan 04 - IWO payment for $50 is posted with a receipt credited date in January.</li>\n \t<li>Feb 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in Feb.</li>\n \t<li>Mar 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in Mar.</li>\n \t<li>Apr 04 - IWO payment for $75 is posted with a receipt credited date in Apr.</li>\n \t<li>May 04 - IWO is disconnected. IWO payment for $75 is posted with a receipt credited date in May.</li>\n \t<li>June 04 - Last IWO payment for $25 is posted with a receipt credited date in June.</li>\n \t<li>July 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in July.</li>\n \t<li>Aug 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in Aug.</li>\n \t<li>Sep 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in Sept.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is September 2004. The obligor needs to make payments for the months of July, August and September*.\n\nExample: The license sanction payment agreement is $50/month. The IWO is $50/month.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Jan 04 - Payment agreement payment for $50 is posted with a receipt credited date in Jan.</li>\n \t<li>Feb 04 - Payment agreement payment for $25 is posted with a receipt credited date in Feb.</li>\n \t<li>Mar 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in Mar.</li>\n \t<li>Apr 04 - IWO payment for $50 is posted with a receipt credited date in Apr.</li>\n \t<li>May 04 - IWO is disconnected. IWO payment for $50 is posted with a receipt credited date in May.</li>\n \t<li>June 04 - Last IWO payment for $25 is posted with a receipt credited date in June.</li>\n \t<li>July 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in July.</li>\n \t<li>Aug 04 - Payment agreement payment for $50 is posted with a receipt credited date in Aug.</li>\n \t<li>Sep 04 - No payment is posted with a receipt credited date in Sep.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is September 2004. The obligor needs to make payments for the months of July and September*.\n\n*A payor must catch up all missed payments before a Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance will be issued. When there is a LISAN payment agreement in place, we must have the LISAN payment agreement amount paid by a REG payment each month. NOTE: If a MIW, IWO, or UIB payment is received in a month, the payor is not required to also make a REG payment in that same month.\n\n<b>Q.</b> If the payor <b>does not have a LISAN payment agreement</b>, is currently sanctioned, and wants to regain his/her licenses and/or vehicle registrations, what must the payor do before I can issue the Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance?\n<b>A.</b> The payor has four options:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Pay all arrears and current support due (pay case to zero), or</li>\n \t<li>Provide income provider information (must be verified), or</li>\n \t<li>Provide exemption information (must be verified), or</li>\n \t<li>Request a conference, attend the conference, and follow through with the requirements from the conference</li>\n</ul>\nThe worker must verify employment, verify the exemption, or schedule &amp; hold a conference. If a payor submits a request for a conference in writing, the worker must send and receive financial statements/documentation, verify that financial information, hold the conference, and then issue the decision. If the decision of the conference is to set up a license sanction payment agreement, the payor must return the signed payment agreement with the first payment before a Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance will be issued.\";}"

ICAR does not load information on vehicles registered to a business, even if the vehicle is registered in the obligor’s name and the business is a sole proprietorship. This is because we cannot sanction the registration of a vehicle owned by a business. We also cannot sanction the registration of a leased vehicle.</p>\n<p><b>Initial Agency Datamatch Report</b></p>\n<p>Previously, when a vehicle registration contained a status code (e.g. \"17\" indicated junking certificate issued for this vehicle), the veh reg stat field on the monthly <i>Initial Agency Datamatch</i> report displayed \"17\".</p>\n<p>Now, when a vehicle registration contains any type of status code, the veh reg stat field on the monthly <i>Initial Agency Datamatch</i> report displays \"AA.\"  When the vehicle registration contains no status code (meaning the registration is valid), the veh reg stat field displays a blank.

This sanction is against the payor’s <i>driving privileges</i>, which means current and future driver’s licenses and current and future vehicle registrations.</li>\n<li>After 35 days from the date DOT sends their notice, DOT’s automated system changes the pending sanction to a <i>suspense</i> or “stop,” unless you issue a <i>Notice of Withdrawal of Certificate of Noncompliance</i>. The “stop” is also placed on the vehicle registration file based on the payor’s SSN. This allows DOT to sanction the registrations of <b>all</b> vehicles registered under the payor’s name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Sending Info to DOT</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ICAR interfaces electronically with DOT’s licensing database. When you enter a date in the gen cert of noncom field on the LISAN screen for a case, ICAR creates and sends a “stop” record to DOT. Similarly, when you enter a date in the gen withdrawal of noncom field for a case, ICAR creates and sends a “withdrawal” record to DOT.</li>\n<li>DOT processes the “stops” and “withdrawals” on a per-case basis. If a payor has more than one case, DOT places a “stop” on the payor’s record for each case having a <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i> sent to DOT. Similarly, if there are multiple “stops” on the payor’s record, the payor’s driving privileges will not be restored until <b>all</b> “stops” are withdrawn for all cases.</li>\n<li>The certificate of mailing on the <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i> was changed to reflect that you are no longer sending an actual copy of the <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i> to DOT.</li>\n<li>If you make an error in generating the <i>Certificate of Noncompliance</i>, entering a date in the gen withdrawal of noncom field on the <i>same day</i> cancels the transaction to DOT.</li>\n</ul>\";i:1582830799055;s:272:\"<p><b>DEER</b> - Deer Hunting License</p>\n<p><b>FISH</b> - Fishing License</p>\n<p><b>HUNT</b> - Hunting License (other than deer or turkey)</p>\n<p><b>TURK</b> - Turkey Hunting License</p>\n<p><b>MISC</b> - Miscellaneous licenses like Ginseng growers and cultivators</p>\";i:1582830799493;s:23:\"[ninja_tables id=\"961\"]\";i:1582830799871;s:245:\"<p><b>ACCL</b> - Cert.

Use this screen to see if someone in prison is working. If so, we can send an income withholding order to the prison to withhold from their earnings. Some inmates work outside of prison for a private company. They return to the prison when their work shift is completed. The name of the company the inmate is working for will be displayed by clicking on the \'\'EYE\'\'. An income withholding order can be sent to these employers in addition to the prison.\n\nThe EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION screen displays the inmate’s work assignments. If the end date field does not have a date in it, the person is currently working. A prisoner may be temporarily without a work assignment because they are being transferred to another facility, they are being disciplined or for other reasons. Therefore, you should not close an payor’s case under the assumption he or she will not have attachable income for the duration of their imprisonment if he or she does not have a current work assignment.\n\nOffenders entering prison are sent to Oakdale (IMCC) for classification. They do not have a work assignment while they are at Oakdale for classification. The majority of prisoners are then assigned to one of the other correctional facilities. A few prisoners do get assigned to serve their sentence at Oakdale and they may or may not have work assignments while they are there.\n\nICAR will load the prison as an employer during the AutoLocate process if they have a work assignment. When you add a prison as an employer for an offender, use the Inmate Accounts address for the prison in the employer database.\n\n[ninja_tables id=\"1063\"]\";i:1584373590320;s:769:\"Access the MOVEMENTS screen from the OFFENDER pull down menu (see example below) to see an offender’s supervision history.

The “permanent and continuous” requirement was codified in Iowa Code and Administrative Rules as the 3-month/3-month rule—a change is “permanent” when it has lasted for 3 months and it is “continuous” when it is expected to last another 3 months.\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>From the Subchapter III, Administrative Modification Section of the Iowa Code Chapter 252H.18A(3) Request for review outside applicable time frames</b>\n3. …a substantial change in circumstances means there has been a change of fifty percent or more in the income of a parent, and the change is due to financial circumstances which have existed for a minimum period of three months and can reasonably be expected to exist for an additional three months.</li>\n \t<li><b>From the Division IV, Review and Adjustment of Child Support Obligations Section of the Iowa Administrative Rules 441—99.62(3)(a)(2) Review outcome</b>\n(2) Variation is due to a change in financial circumstances which has lasted at least three months and can reasonably be expected to last for an additional three months.</li>\n \t<li><b>From the Division V, Administrative Modification Section of the Iowa Administrative Rules 441—99.81(252H) Definitions</b>\n2. The change is due to financial circumstances which have existed for a minimum period of three months and can reasonably be expected to exist for an additional three months, pursuant to Iowa Code section 252H.18A.</li>\n \t<li><b>Iowa Administrative Rules 441—99.83(1) Substantial change of circumstances</b>\na. A change of at least 50 percent in the net income of a parent as defined by guidelines. The new net income will be compared to the net income upon which the current child support obligation was based.\nb. The change is due to financial circumstances which have existed for a minimum period of three months and can reasonably be expected to exist for an additional three months.</li>\n \t<li><b>Iowa Administrative Rules 441—99.91(5) Denying requests; Change of circumstances</b>\nc. The change in income has not yet lasted for three months, as required in paragraph 99.83(1)“b,” or\nd. The change in income is not expected to last another three months, as required in paragraph 99.83(1)“b,” or</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Administrative Modification</b>A customer may request an administrative modification due to a substantial change of circumstances; to add an additional child to the support order; to set reserved child support; to correct an error or omission in a child support order; when a minor obligor fails to comply with parenting class or education requirements; or for a cost-of-living alteration.\n\nThe 3-month/3-month rule <b>only</b> applies to administrative modifications for substantial change of circumstances. In other words, you should only postpone an administrative modification on ICAR using the FIN reason if the admod request was due to a party’s substantial change in their financial circumstances (ADMODRESN code SC).\n\n1. Mrs. A requests a modification because a new child was born and she wants to get the child added to the existing order. Last week, Mr. A started a new job. He was working at Home Depot and is now working at Lowe’s.\n\nRegardless of Mr. A’s current income, because the purpose of the modification is to add a child, accept the request and proceed with Admod. Do not postpone the action due to the change in financial circumstances not being ‘permanent’ and ‘continuous.’</li>\n \t<li><b>Review</b>A customer does not need to meet the substantial change requirement in order to qualify for a review. A child support obligation qualifies for the review process if it has been at least two years from the filing date of the support order or most recent modification or the last completed review, whichever is later.\n\nHowever, after you have accepted a review that meets the two-year requirement, a party’s financial situation may change in a way that triggers the 3-month/3-month rule.\n\n2. Mr. B requests a modification. The existing order was entered four years ago and has not been modified. You accept the request and begin a Review action. While calculating guidelines, you notice that Mr. B changed from working at Casey’s General Store to working at the State of Iowa 1 month ago. Mr. B’s income has changed in the last 3 months.\n\nAt this point in the Review process, you must postpone the process because Mr. B’s recent change in income has not yet existed for 3 months and thus does not yet meet the 3-month/3-month requirement.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Part 3: Accepting or Denying the Modification Request</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Admod</b>Per Iowa Code and Administrative Rules (see above), a party’s change in financial circumstances must have existed for a minimum of three months in order to qualify for a modification due to substantial change. If a customer requests a modification due to substantial change before their financial circumstances have existed for three months, you should deny the request. Use Admod deny reason 13 – Request is for substantial change and there is no proof of a substantial change. Inform the customer of the 3-month/3-month rule and when it would be more appropriate for them to submit their modification request. This allows the customer to establish the “permanent” requirement of the 3-month/3-month rule.\n\nOnce the permanent requirement has been met, you can use a reasonable person standard to determine if the financial circumstances will last another 3 months, and meet the “continuous” requirement of the rule. Denying the modification request does not create a hardship for the customer; <span class=\"color: red;\">recurring postponements may. Explain the reasons for the two 3-month periods when you talk to customers so they understand, including the reasoning that it can be better to wait in case more changes happen during either three month period, which would cause more delays.</span>\n\n1. Mrs. C requests a modification because she was laid off from her job at Principal Financial last month and has not found a replacement. She is working some odd jobs, but is having a hard time fulfilling the existing court ordered support amount so wants the support lowered. The existing order was last modified 10 months ago.\n\nBecause the modification was requested due to Mrs. C’s substantial change in income and the change has not lasted 3 months, do not accept the Admod application and postpone the action until the financial circumstances are considered ‘permanent’ and ‘continuous.’ Instead, deny the request.</li>\n \t<li><b>Review</b>A review must be accepted and determined appropriate before you apply postponement procedures. If you know immediately that the parties don’t meet the 3-month/3-month criteria, accept the review request in one step, and then postpone the review in a second step. You don’t have to serve the parties before postponing. If the substantial change happens later in the process, postpone when you know about it.\n\n2. Mr. D requests a modification because he is now working a lower paying job. He was previously working for Wells Fargo, but 3 weeks ago he became self-employed running his own accounting business. He does not have a lot of business yet and is having a hard time fulfilling the existing court ordered support amount so wants the support lowered. The existing order was last modified 3 years ago.\n\nBecause it has been at least two years since the order was last modified, Mr. D qualifies for a review and you must accept the request and proceed with a review action.\n\nHowever, because Mr. D’s income change is not yet 3 months old, you must postpone the review action until his income change has existed for 3 months and can reasonably be expected to last another 3 months.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Part 4: Determining the Income Change</b>\n\nThe customer’s substantial change in income must have existed for a minimum period of three months <u>and</u> must be reasonably expected to exist for an additional three months. During a modification, the 3-month/3-month rule is triggered by an <b>income change</b>, not necessarily an employment change.\n\nFor example, if a customer changes employers, but is performing the same kind of job at the same rate of pay, there is no substantial change in financial circumstances. Similarly, if a customer changes employers, is working a completely different kind of job, but is still making roughly the same amount of monthly income, there is no substantial change. Also, if a customer changes positions with the same employer but is making a different wage, a substantial change may have occurred, depending on the difference in wage.\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Admod</b>To determine if a customer’s income has changed by 50% or more, compare the customer’s current net income to the net income used to set the current obligation. If the customer has another income change during the course of the admod, remember you are not comparing the second income change to the first income change. You are still comparing the second income change to the income used to set the current obligation. If the second income change does not meet the 50% requirement, you can end the modification process.\n\n1. Mrs. E requests an admod based on a substantial change in her income. The order was last modified 8 months ago. At the time the existing obligation was set, Mrs. E was working at Nationwide. Three months ago, she lost her job and began receiving unemployment benefits which are over 50% less than her income at Nationwide. You accept the request.\n\nAfter you have served both parties, Mrs. E calls you and reports she is back at Nationwide, making the same income as she was making in her old position. Mrs. E’s income is no longer 50% different than the income used to set the current obligation and thus no longer meets the requirements of the 3-month/3-month rule. End the process, with a 5, and narrate.</li>\n \t<li><b>Review</b>In the review process, the customer’s income does not have to have changed by 50% or more. Instead, the change in income must result in an obligation that varies from the current child support obligation by more than 20%.\n\n2. Mr. F requests a modification because his income has gone down and he would like his child support obligation reviewed. The order was last modified 4 years ago and qualifies for a review and adjustment.\n\nMr. F’s income at the time of the original order was $90,000 per year. Due to a job change than happened a year ago, Mr. F now makes $60,000 per year. The new child support amount varies from the old amount by more than 20%, but less than 50%. Because this is the review and adjustment process, the change meets the required variance and you may continue with modification.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Part 5: Use of System and Personal Calendar Flags</b>\n\nWhen you postpone an admod or review on ICAR for substantial change in financial circumstances, the system issues calendar flags to check on the status of the customer’s financial information. These flags are set 90 days and 180 days from the calendar date you make entries to postpone the process. If you are able to postpone the process shortly after the customer’s financial change occurs, the system flag will properly serve as a reminder to check on the status of the customer’s financial information when you might be able to continue with the modification.\n\n<b><u>Admod</u></b>\n\n[ninja_tables id=\"1092\"]\n\n<b><u>Review</u></b>\n\n[ninja_tables id=\"1093\"]\n\nHowever, if you receive information about a customer’s financial change when it has already existed for a period of time, you also need to set a personal flag for 3 months from the date the change occurred. This will allow you to more accurately track when a customer’s financial change has met the “permanent” requirement of the 3-month/3-month rule, while also preventing the admod or review from being postponed longer than 3 months.\n\nIf a customer reports another change in financial circumstances while the process is currently postponed, you will need to set new flags to track the new 3-month period. You can do this by reopening the process and re-postponing it, and setting a personal flag if necessary to correctly track the 3-month time period.\n\nHowever, remember that for an admod, if the new income change is not a 50% or more change from the income used to set the current obligation, you can end the admod rather than re-postponing and setting new flags.\n\n<b>Part 6: Narrating the Postponement</b>\n\nWhen you postpone an admod on ADMOD1, ICAR issues narrative ADMOD14 – “Admod postponed because financial information did not meet the 3-month/3-month rule.” When you postpone a review on REVIEW1, ICAR issues narrative REV25 – “Review of support order postponed due to 3-month/3-month rule (temporary status of finances). Status generated for payor, payee, and any necessary third party.” The automatic ICAR narratives do not contain case-specific details. Whenever you postpone an admod or review for change in financial circumstances, you need to narrate the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Which party had the change in financial circumstances</li>\n \t<li>What the old source of income was and what the new source of income is</li>\n \t<li>How long the change has existed and when the second 3 month period will end</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Part 7: Weekly Reports</b>\n\nThe weekly Admod and Review reports contain information regarding currently postponed cases. Use this report each week to track the progress of postponed admods and reviews. The reports include columns for “Postponed Reason/Date” and “Review (or Admod) Reopened.” By regularly reviewing these dates, you can prevent admods and reviews from sitting idle after ICAR automatically reopens them when the 3-month time period expires.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>3-month/3-month Q &amp; A Sessions</h3>\n(11/2014)\n\n<b>Q1. </b>If a payee changes job, loses a job, or gets a job during the review/admod process and the payor is unemployed (the order will be a minimum order regardless) is it necessary to postpone?\n\n<b>A1. </b>Iowa law and rules are not party-specific when it comes to who must meet the 3-month/3-month rule. We choose to postpone when there is a substantial change in financial circumstance for either parent. This is because we want to be using the correct income for <b>both</b> parties, regardless of whether the resulting order will be a minimum order.\n\n<b>Q2. </b>If the payee or payor is a job hopper, postponing every 3 months may result in the review or admod dragging on for many months or possibly years. Is it okay to proceed at some point maybe using wage reporting income?\n\n<b>A2. </b>The key here is to look for an income change, not just an employment change. If the customer is changing jobs often, but still making roughly the same amount of income, you would not need to postpone.\n\nPlease refer to Part 4: Determining the Income Change, <i>second paragraph</i>. Example 1 - \"is performing the same kind of job at the same rate of pay\" means working for minimum wage at Casey\'\'s vs. Quik Trip. Example 2 - \"is working a completely different kind of job but is still making roughly the same amount of monthly income\" means working retail at $30,000 per year ($2,500 per month) vs working for Iowa Department of Health at $32,000 per year ($2,667 per month). $167 dollars a month is not a substantial change. You would not need to postpone in either of these situations.\n\n<b>Q3. </b>Is there a margin, dollar amount, or maybe percentage that workers can use to determine if a change in income is substantial enough to postpone? (For example, is it necessary to postpone if there is a $1.00 an hour change?) Some changes are easy and obvious to determine. Other changes are questionable.\n\n<b>A3. </b>This question deals with a second (or third, etc.) change in income after the modification process has been started (i.e., you have accepted the admod request, served the parties and are about to complete guidelines when you are informed that one of the parties has changed jobs). The questions you want to ask in each case scenario are:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Is the new change still a 50% change from the net income used to set the current obligation?</li>\n \t<li>Can this new change reasonably be expected to exist for an additional 3 months?</li>\n</ol>\nIf the parties are unhappy with the use of this income, they have the right to request a hearing. You would use a reasonable person standard in these situations - if you are unsure on whether or not you should postpone the process due to the new income, you can contact us for assistance.\n\n<b>Q4. </b>After reading this information we are wondering if we would ever postpone for FIN in ADMOD or if we would always just deny the ADMOD? Here are some examples:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Parent A has a 50% change in income that meets the 3mo/3mo rule. We initiate an ADMOD. Parent A continues to have the 50% change and meet the 3mo/3mo rule. Parent B has a change in income during the course of the ADMOD. Do we postpone for Parent B or just continue with the ADMOD because Parent A continues to meet the 50% change and 3mo/mo rule?</li>\n \t<li>Parent A has a 50% change in income that meets the 3mo/3mo rule. We initiate an ADMOD. At point of guidelines, Parent A has had a change in income again. It still meets the 50% change. Do we need to look at 3 mo/3mo again? Would we postpone or deny or simply proceed? (Parent A income in original guidelines was $3000/mo. Parent A goes on UIB and gets $1000/m and applies for ADMOD after 3 months or more of UIB. We initiate ADMOD and then at point of guidelines the UIB has just ended. Now the income is zero.) Do we deny? Postpone? Or just proceed?</li>\n \t<li>Parent A has a 50% change in income that meets the 3mo/3mo rule. We initiate an ADMOD. At point of guidelines, Parent Aâ€™s income no longer meets the 50% change. Do we just deny/end the ADMOD or should we also check the income of Parent B to see there is a possible 50% change in income for that parent?</li>\n</ol>\n<b>A4. </b>\n<ol>\n \t<li>See question 1. Both parties need to meet the 3-month/3-month rule.</li>\n \t<li>You would postpone the admod. The 50% change still exists; but now you must postpone the process to determine if it will meet the 3-month/3-month rule. <b>NOTE:</b> This is different than what you would do in the example in questions 2 and 3. A change in income from $1000 per month to $0 per month is a much more drastic change than earning $1 or $2 more per hour. The change in this example would drastically change the resulting recommended amount of support. The reasonable person standard would direct you to postpone in this situation.</li>\n \t<li>Generate a no change Admod NOD from the ADMOD3 screen. In the NOD, you\'\'ll put an \"X\" in the \"Modification is not appropriate because none of the criteria for an administrative modification were met\" line and remove the \"X\" from the substantial change line. This NOD includes the language that notifies the party of their right to request a hearing. End the Admod process with a 2 - ADMOD completed, modification not appropriate.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Q5. </b>Can we deny an ADMOD after we have sent and served the NOI? Or do we process end the ADMOD using the \"Other\" reason and narrate?\n\n<b>A5. </b>No, you cannot deny after you have accepted a modification (either review or admod). You must end the process with an appropriate code.\n\n<b>Q6. </b>Do we really not need to serve parties before postponing a review?\n\n<b>A6. </b>There is no requirement to serve the parties before postponing. \"Postponement\" means you don\'\'t have to take any action until the postponement period is up. However, if your local office procedure is to continue with service, there is nothing prohibiting that. We know that some offices, as a best practice, get service out of the way while waiting for the 3 months to pass because in some instances it can take 2-3 months to get service done on a person.\n\n<b>Q7. </b>If we initiate an ADMOD due to a 50% change and the 3-month/3-month rule is met, and then at the point of guidelines we determine that the 50% change and 3-month/3-month rule is no longer met, how do we end the ADMOD?\n\n<b>A7. </b>See 4 c. c.\n\n<b>Q8. </b>Do the parties have the opportunity to challenge or request a hearing if we decide to end the ADMOD?\n\n<b>A8. </b>The have the same opportunity as when we end an ADMOD without making a change to the obligation. As explained above in answer 4 c. c., the no change Admod NOD includes information about their right to challenge or request a hearing. You are not required to complete and send guidelines with a no change Admod NOD.\n\nIf you have already sent an NOD with the guidelines, the NOD has that same information regarding the right to request a hearing, as in any other admod.\n\n<b>Q9. </b>What do we do if we receive a request for admod and the substantial change has not quite existed for 3 months yet (i.e., it has existed for 2 and a half months)? Are we able to accept that or must we deny it?\n\n<b>A9. </b>You do have the authority to deny it. However, if the customer is very close to meeting the first 3 month requirement and you do choose to accept the admod, you must set a personal flag for when the 3 month period will be up. If you only postpone on the ADMOD1 screen, the system flag will be set for 3 months from the date you enter the postponement. This will lead to the case being postponed for far longer than necessary and can lead to multiple postponements if other changes come up while it is postponed.\n\n<b>Q10. </b>Say we have a situation where a person ends employment and goes to prison. They apply for an admod during the first month of being in prison (so during month 1 of their substantial change). Can we accept their admod request if we know they will be in prison for longer than 6 months?\n\n<b>A10. </b>We do not have the expertise to predict what will happen with someoneâ€™s sentence when they are sent to prison. Our recommendation would be to deny the admod for not meeting the 3-month/3-month requirement, and inform the customer they can reapply after their substantial change has existed for 3 months.\n\n<b>Q11. </b>We do not have a case file but felt we needed some clarification. In the example below, we were not ending the Admod process we were going ahead with guidelines, etc.\n\nOrder established within the past year.\nOne of the parties of case file request or completes application for modification- based on job lost.\nWithin another month parties have been served and the individual that lost their job, has now found a new job.\nBy your directions, we should end the Admod process if there is no longer 50 percent change in income.\nBy doing this, the party can no longer request a court hearing because the process has ended.\nAre we interpreting your directions, correctly?\n\n<b>A11. </b>The correct way to end the Admod process for the above example is:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Generate a no change Admod NOD from the ADMOD3 screen. In the NOD, you\'\'ll put an \"X\" in the Modification is not appropriate because none of the criteria for an administrative modification were met\" line and remove the \"X\" from the substantial change line. This NOD includes the language that notifies the party of their right to request a hearing.</li>\n \t<li>End the Admod process with a 2 - ADMOD completed, modification not appropriate.</li>\n \t<li>You do not need to complete guidelines to send with this NOD.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Special Circumstances - Prisoner Cases</h3>\n<b>Incarcerated Payor Letter Process</b>\n\nPer federal regulations, child support agencies must now take action to let parties know they can request a modification when the agency learns a payor will be incarcerated for over 180 days. CSRU will notify parties of the ability to request a modification, in order to bring incarcerated payors\'\' obligations in line with their current income and ability to pay. The federal regulation Iowa chose to implement requires CSRU to notify both the payor and the payee on the case.\n\nCentral Office created the following documents for staff to use in complying with this regulation:\n<ul>\n \t<li>an \"Incarcerated Payor Letter\" Word document with fillable fields,</li>\n \t<li>an instruction sheet explaining when the Incarcerated Payor Letter does and does not need to be sent to a case party, how to complete the letter, and required case actions, and</li>\n \t<li>a checklist to determine when the Incarcerated Payor Letter does and does not need to be sent to a case party.</li>\n</ul>\nPlease begin using these procedures effective December 1, 2017\n\nWe do not expect or require staff to sort through cases with the sole purpose of finding incarcerated payors. If you are reviewing a case (for any reason) after the effective date of the policy, and you find that the payor is currently incarcerated AND will continue to be incarcerated for another 180 days, you need to follow these procedures, as appropriate.\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/Review/Contents/SpecialCircumstances/Prisoner%20Cases/Field_Instructions_for_%20IncarceratedPayorLetter.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/word.png\" /> <b>Link to Instruction Sheet</b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/Review/Contents/SpecialCircumstances/Prisoner%20Cases/Incarcerated_Payor_Letter_Checklist.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/word.png\" /> <b>Link to Checklist</b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/Review/Contents/SpecialCircumstances/Prisoner%20Cases/Incarcerated_Payor_Letter.docx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/word.png\" /> <b>Link to Letter</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Processing Modifications</b>\n\nWhen issuing the NOD for Review or Admod on a prisoner case, manually generate a \"Proposed Order\" based on the Guideline Worksheet.\n\nYou will need to attach a post-it note that says \"Proposed Order.\"\n\nSend one original Proposed Order and one copy (customer copy) for the payor to keep for his/her records along with the NOD, the Guidelines Worksheet and the Child Support Declaration.\n\nAsk the incarcerated payor to review these documents and sign and return the Child Support Declaration if he/she is in agreement with the Proposed Order.\n\nSee the <a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/Review/Contents/SpecialCircumstances/Prisoner%20Cases/Payor\'\'s%20Declaration%20Cover%20Letter.doc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/word.png\" /> <b>sample cover letter</b></a>.\n\nAfter sending the Child Support Declaration to the incarcerated Payor, set a flag for: \"Check on return of the Child Support Declaration. Contact the payor\'\'s counselor if not returned.\"\n\nIf the payor does not sign and return the Child Support Declaration, you may attempt to contact the inmate\'\'s counselor, by phone or in writing. Use the following suggested language:\n\n\"Would you please verify that the recent documents mailed to (inmate\'\'s name) were in fact received by (inmate\'\'s name). If (inmate\'\'s name) has any questions about the documents, I can be reached at (phone number) or (inmate\'\'s name) may contact his/her own attorney.\n\nIf at any point during the modification you must change the language of the Proposed Order, resend the Proposed Order along with a new Child Support Declaration to for the payor to sign. Hopefully the payor will sign and return the child support declaration to you by the end of the waiting period so that you immediately proceed with entering the new order.\n\n<b>Note:</b> Be sure to avoid releasing confidential information.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Tribes &amp; Child Support</h3>\n<b>OVERVIEW</b>\n\nThe Personal Responsibility And Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA, Public Law, 104-193) and amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33) authorizes the direct funding of tribal child support enforcement programs by the federal government.\n\nTribes may have non-IV-D child support programs and their tribal courts may issue child support orders. For example, the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska had a non-IV-D child support program before attaining IV-D status in November 2008.\n\nYou must observe the same confidentiality requirements when working with non-IV-D tribal child support programs as you would any other non-IV-D entity. See TRIBAL IV-D AGENCIES for information about confidentiality requirements when dealing with a IV-D tribal agency.\n\nIf a tribal child support program (IV-D or non-IV-D) contacts you requesting assistance, send their contact information to <a href=\"mailto:csrupolicytribes@dhs.state.ia.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>CSRU Policy – Tribes</b></a> and Central Office staff will assist them.\n\n<b> TRIBAL IV-D AGENCIES</b>\n\nTribal IV-D programs must comply with the Full Faith &amp; Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA), but not the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). Tribal IV-D agencies are subject to the provisions of 45 CFR 309. <span style=\"color: red;\">For a list of Tribal IV-D agencies</span> <a href=\"?page_id=1094\"><b>click here</b></a>.\n\nThey are required to perform the same basic services as states. This includes enforcing and modifying child and medical support orders issued by other states, tribes and countries in accordance with FFCCSOA.\n\nTribal IV-D programs can:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Establish Paternity</li>\n \t<li>Establish Child Support Orders (Health care is not required but may be included)</li>\n \t<li>Enforce Support Orders, including Direct Income Withholding</li>\n \t<li>Modify Support Orders</li>\n \t<li>Share information with other IV-D programs (with some exceptions)</li>\n</ul>\nTribal IV-D programs may make arrangements with states for federal offsets. Iowa does not have this agreement with any Tribal IV-D agencies.\n\nTribal IV-D agencies can access the FPLS directly or they can make arrangements with states to access the FPLS for them. Iowa does not have this agreement with any Tribal IV-D agencies.\n\nYou may share the same types of information that is already on ICAR with Tribal IV-D programs as you do with State IV-D programs. However, information received from the IRS cannot be redisclosed unless independently verified. In addition, information received directly from FPLS or the FCR cannot be disclosed. Do not initiate new FPLS locate searches on behalf of the tribes. See <a href=\"?page_id=1106\"><b>Tribal Confidentiality</b></a> for addition information on what can be shared with tribes. Refer to <a href=\"?page_id=1113\"><b>IRS Address Verification</b></a> and the INTERSTATE CHILD SUPPORT CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES (UIFSA) section of <a href=\"http://dhs.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/9-a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/pdf.png\" /> <b>9-A, General Program Information</b></a> for more information.\n\nThe Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska and Meskwaki Nation Child Support are the only tribes with Indian country in Iowa that have a IV-D agency. The Sioux City office handles case processing for CSRU that involves Winnebago Child Support. The Waterloo office handles intergovernmental case processing that involves Meskwaki Nation Child Support. The Ottumwa office handles all modifications that involve Meskwaki Nation Child Support.\n\n<b>VERIFICATION OF TRIBAL IV-D AGENCY</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/css/resource/state-and-tribal-child-support-agency-contacts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>This link</b></a> has a map which lists all states and the tribal agencies in that state. All tribes with an “*” beside them are in the start-up phase of becoming an approved Tribal IV-D agency. Until a tribe becomes an approved Tribal IV-D agency, do not release information to that tribe.\n\n<b>ADDING TRIBAL COURT ORDERS TO ICAR – HEALTH INSURANCE</b>\n\nTribal court orders are frequently silent with regard to health insurance coverage. This is because there is no requirement for tribal court orders to include medical support. However, tribes are encouraged to make sure children have access to medical care through the Indian Health Service (IHS).\n\nWhen the ONLY medical support language mentioned in the order is about the child(ren) having access to medical care through Indian Health Services, enter a \"Y\" in the hi/ms ordered field on the COURTORD screen.\n\nOn the HEALTH INSURANCE UPDATE screen:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Enter a \"Y\" in the health ins field,</li>\n \t<li>Enter a \"Y\" in the payee field under PARTY ORDERED TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE, and</li>\n \t<li>Enter an “N” in the cash med support field.</li>\n</ul>\nThese steps ensure the MEDSUM program doesn\'\'t attempt to enforce health insurance against a payor.\n\nFinally, enter a narrative that explains the \"Y\" entry on the payee field on HIUPDATE screen is actually IHS.\n\nIf the order does NOT mention the child(ren) having access to medical care through Indian Health Services, does NOT require a parent to provide a health benefit plan, and does NOT require a parent to pay cash medical support, enter an \"N\" in the hi/ms ordered field on the COURTORD screen.\n\nIf you have questions about whether language in the order refers to IHS, send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:csrupolicytribes@dhs.state.ia.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>CSRU Policy – Tribes</b></a>.\n\n<b>REGISTERING AND MODIFYING TRIBAL COURT ORDERS</b>\n\nBefore registering a tribal support order, contact the tribe involved to determine whether or not they still have jurisdiction and are enforcing. Handle as you would any other foreign support order you are registering for modification.\n\nBefore modifying a tribal court order, review the case with your office attorney or Central Office. You must give “full faith and credit” (FFCCSOA) to tribal support orders. Sometimes a tribe will have jurisdiction on a case even when all parties do not live on the settlement.\n\n<b>FILING TRIBAL COURT ORDERS FOR ENFORCMENT</b>\n\nIt is recommended that tribal court orders be registered in Iowa rather than filed for enforcement. Before registering a tribal support order, contact the tribe involved to determine whether or not they still have jurisdiction and are enforcing.\n\n<b>INCOME WITHHOLDING</b>\n\nBefore sending an IWO to an employer, review to see if instructions are provided in <a><b><i>Direct Withholding vs. Intergovernmental Referral</i></b></a>.

See Verification of Tribal IV-D Agency for more information.\n\nIf you find out that a payor is receiving per capita from a tribe with a IV-D agency, contact the tribe to find out whether CSRU is able to attach the per capita. Find out what documentation the tribe needs from CSRU to attach the per capita.\n\nIf you receive information that the payor is receiving per capita or a stipend from a tribe without a IV-D agency, send an email to <a href=\"mailto:csrupolicytribes@dhs.state.ia.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>CSRU Policy – Tribes</b></a> with the case information and the name of the tribe.\n\n<b>TRIBAL TANF AND THE $25 ANNUAL FEE</b>\n\nIn addition to IV-D agencies, tribes may operate TANF programs.

During the course of their training, the trainers - Breehan Gerleman and Martha Stewart - collected \"best practice tips\" from around the state. Below you will find a link to those tips. As additional information regarding this training becomes available, it will be added here.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Best practices collected from the field</h3>\n<b>To handle an enthusiastic talker</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Let the customer talk, and make a note of each separate concern voiced. Then, when the customer is through, say \"Let’s take one concern at a time\" and discuss each concern.</li>\n \t<li>If you must interrupt the customer, try to do so when the customer is on a positive point. Then, when you continue the conversation and move it in another direction, you can do so with a positive transition—and hopefully keep the conversation going in a positive direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>To shake a reluctant talker loose</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Use active listening to encourage a customer to add new information to the conversation. Try paraphrasing what a reluctant talker has just told you, as in \"So, you’re working full time now.\" Then, pause and wait for the customer to add some additional information, like where he or she is working or how long he or she has been working.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When using TDD to communicate with hearing impaired customers</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Be especially careful that your wording and expression is professional and clear. The TDD operator transcribes <i>everything</i>, even \"uh\" and \"um,\" just as it is said.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>If you sense a customer has difficulty reading or writing</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Offer to work with the customer to fill out the application. Then, conduct an interview, using the form as a guide and fill out the form for the customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>To work with an angry customer</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Avoid using the statement \"I understand.\" Instead, use a phrase like - \"That sounds like it would be difficult.\" Using the statement \"I understand\" typically further agitates the customer because it implies the CSRU employee has experienced the exact situation as the customer, and, in most cases, the CSRU employee has not. Using a phrase like \"That sounds like it would be difficult\" implies empathy and concern but does not assume a first-hand understanding of the customer’s situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>To assist a customer who does not speak or write English</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Ask the customer to send a letter into the office in English that makes his or her requests.</li>\n \t<li>Ask the customer to bring in his or her own interpreter to the office. Remember to obtain ROI before starting communication through an interpreter.</li>\n \t<li>Create a list of local translation resources to distribute to customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>To best remind yourself and your co-workers to complete necessary case actions</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Use calendar flags (rather than Outlook’s calendar) as reminders. If reminders are in calendar flags, any and all employees can view reminders and act on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When leaving messages and requesting a customer calls back</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Offer both your private phone number (if you have one) <b>and</b> the 1-800 number so customers can decide which number they would prefer to use. If it\'\'s a long-distance call for customers, they might prefer the 1-800 number.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When writing narratives</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Offer enough detail so attorneys can build a contempt case. Detail all case information as your observations (\"NCP appeared angry and did not answer questions asked of him\"), rather than judgments you are making about the case or customer (\"NCP is always angry and won’t work with us\"). Narratives are part of a legal document.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When talking with an NCP\'\'s family member that claims no knowledge of his or her whereabouts</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Ask the family member how he or she would contact the NCP if there was an emergency or if someone died.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When negotiating a partial payment agreement with NCPs</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Ask them first how much they think they can pay. This gives them a sense of control over the situation and sometimes they may offer a larger payment than you were going to ask for.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When answering customers’ questions</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>If you don\'\'t know the answer to a customer\'\'s question, don\'\'t be afraid to admit that and offer to go find an answer.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When calling for location information</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Identify yourself as calling from the State of Iowa. If the location contact questions your affiliation, you can state that you\'\'re calling for the Department of Human Services. If they question you further, explain that you have personal business with the individual in question and you would appreciate their help in locating them. Do not reveal any information that could compromise the NCP\'\'s confidentiality.</li>\n \t<li>If a former (or current) employer is reluctant to share the NCP\'\'s contact information with you or claims that the NCP is not an employee, ask if you can add that statement to the case record. This official sounding request will often convince them to cooperate.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When talking on the phone with a customer</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>If you need to look up something in ICAR or do anything else that keeps you rather quiet for a moment or two, explain to the customer what it is you\'\'re doing so they are included in the process. Don\'\'t just let the phone line go silent while you do a search.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When working with customers face-to-face</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>If customers ask you to hold their baby while they fill out paperwork, consider purchasing a used infant carrier to avoid any legal issues associated with handing customers’ children. Then you can explain to customers that you\'\'d love to hold their infant, but you\'\'re not allowed to and then offer them the carrier.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\nBelow are links to two community mediation programs that can be offered to customers with disputes about custody and/or visitation:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://www.creativejustice.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>The Center for Creative Justice</b></a> - This site serves families in Story County.</li>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://www.famres.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Family Resources Inc.</b></a> - Locations in Bettendorf, Burlington, Clinton, Davenport and Muscatine.</li>\n</ul>\";i:1584644436861;s:2671:\"<b>Things to consider regarding change in living arrangement (custody) inquiries</b>\n\nThe following information should be considered in all change of living arrangement issues or complaints.

Dealing with difficult customers might cause you to label your customers, call names, or stereotype your customers (not to their face, but privately)-this is how a negative filter is created. Negative filters are contagious; if left unchecked, negative filters can spin out of control, and destroy any possibility of positive communication with the customer. The way out of the negative filter is a service filter. A \"service filter\" is when you ask yourself, <b>\"What does this customer need and how can I provide it?\"</b>\n\nThe question changes your focus (your filter) — from negative personal feelings to a service provider attitude — and highlights the issues that need to be addressed.\n\n<hr />\n\nSuggestions for when a customer becomes belligerent or offensive during a <b>face-to-face</b> situation:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Listen to the customer\'\'s concerns.</li>\n \t<li>Take notes while the customer vents. Then address one issue at a time.</li>\n \t<li>Empathize. Explain issues can be resolved if we remain calm and concentrate on the issues.</li>\n \t<li>Speak calmly, use eye contact, allow customer to vent; use ‘I’ statements (see <b>Top 10 Phrases</b>).</li>\n \t<li>Remain calm and speak in a normal tone of voice.</li>\n \t<li>Treat the customer with respect and honesty. Tell them the facts.</li>\n \t<li>Calm the customer by reassuring the person that you will work to find resolution.</li>\n \t<li>Focus on what you or the customer CAN DO.</li>\n \t<li>Explain the answer in more than one way to help the customer understand.</li>\n \t<li>Give the customer phone numbers of other organizations that might be able to help.</li>\n \t<li>Ask for assistance from lead worker/supervisor. Follow your office\'\'s policy for asking for assistance.</li>\n \t<li>Explain the behavior you expect from the customer (example: If the customer is using profanity, request that the customer stop using profanity).</li>\n \t<li>If the customer is threatening, call the supervisor, advise that CSRU does not take threats lightly, and that you must report threats to the authorities.</li>\n \t<li>When appropriate, call the police.</li>\n \t<li>Use a CODE system for safety and verbal signals. For example:\nIf you ask for the \"green form\" you are asking a co-worker to walk by. If you ask for the \"yellow form\" you are asking a co-worker to come into room. If you ask for a \"red form\" you are asking a co-worker to call 911. (These are examples. Follow your office policy).</li>\n \t<li>If the customer continues to act irate, terminate the visit. Ask the customer to return when he or she is calm. Offer to set up a time to discuss the matter. If they refuse to leave, follow your office\'\'s procedures for contacting the police.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\nSuggestions for when the customer becomes belligerent or offensive during a <b>phone call</b>:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Try to be a good listener and do not interrupt.</li>\n \t<li>Try to get to the bottom of the real issue as quickly as possible.</li>\n \t<li>Take notes on the issues; narrate completely.</li>\n \t<li>Don\'\'t place blame or make excuses.</li>\n \t<li>Try explaining the information in another way.</li>\n \t<li>Find a common ground on something both can agree on ex: the child support order was filed in May ’99.</li>\n \t<li>Try to get the customer back on track.</li>\n \t<li>Ask if the customer would like a minute or two to calm down.</li>\n \t<li>Remain calm in voice and manner, allow the customer to vent, and provide accurate responses. Determine whether the conversation can end positively or whether it\'\'s time to end the call.</li>\n \t<li>If there is no calming the customer, politely indicate you would like to speak with them at a later time when they\'\'ve had a chance to calm down so that you may address their concerns productively.</li>\n \t<li>In situations where the customer has a history of inappropriate behavior (belligerent, offensive, or making false claims about what worker said) be prepared to use the speakerphone. Have another staff person sit in the office and witness the conversation or ask permission from the customer to tape the conversation \'\'for quality assurance purposes\'\'.</li>\n \t<li>Try to speak in calm, low tones. If the caller refuses to heed warnings of terminating the call (based on foul language, repeating same things 4-5 times, etc.), clearly state, \"I am terminating this conversation. Goodbye,\" and hang up.</li>\n \t<li>Ask the supervisor or lead worker to intervene, if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>The top ten phrases to avoid, and the alternatives</b>\n\n[ninja_tables id=\"1137\"]\n<ul>\n \t<li>Phrases to avoid when attempting to keep the conversation\nfrom escalating</li>\n \t<li>Suggested phrases to use to keep the conversation from escalating</li>\n \t<li>Suggested phrases to use for de-escalating a conversation, when the customer is very upset</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Phrases to <i>avoid</i> when attempting to keep the conversation from escalating</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>You don’t seem to understand</li>\n \t<li>You are not listening</li>\n \t<li>We can not help you</li>\n \t<li>You did not hear me</li>\n \t<li>Excuses why work is not done</li>\n \t<li>Hey you loser</li>\n \t<li>Why don’t you get a job</li>\n \t<li>Hey, don’t get angry with me, you slept with him</li>\n \t<li>You are wrong</li>\n \t<li>Nothing can be done</li>\n \t<li>It doesn’t matter because</li>\n \t<li>You failed to do this</li>\n \t<li>Laying blame statements</li>\n \t<li>I know how you feel</li>\n \t<li>I can not assist you</li>\n \t<li>You should have done</li>\n \t<li>I don’t think you understand</li>\n \t<li>It’s not my decision</li>\n \t<li>This is not my fault</li>\n \t<li>The computer did it, or the computer didn’t</li>\n \t<li>Sorry there is nothing we can do for you, get a private attorney</li>\n \t<li>It’s our policy</li>\n \t<li>It’s our procedure</li>\n \t<li>But</li>\n \t<li>Never</li>\n \t<li>Always</li>\n \t<li>It was your responsibility</li>\n \t<li>You have to</li>\n \t<li>I have to</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Suggested phrases to use to keep the conversation from <i>escalating</i></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>I understand</li>\n \t<li>We want to help you</li>\n \t<li>I can’t answer that question, but I will get someone that can</li>\n \t<li>CSRU cannot help, but I will attempt to lead them to another agency/someone who can</li>\n \t<li>I wish I could do more</li>\n \t<li>Let me do some research on this topic to ensure I have looked at every option</li>\n \t<li>I see</li>\n \t<li>Okay</li>\n \t<li>I noted that</li>\n \t<li>I appreciate you taking the time</li>\n \t<li>I can do this</li>\n \t<li>Sorry that happened</li>\n \t<li>I’m glad you came by</li>\n \t<li>Perhaps if I explain the program to you</li>\n \t<li>I will do everything I can to help you</li>\n \t<li>Let’s discuss calmly what can be done</li>\n \t<li>I am here to help anyway I can</li>\n \t<li>I will investigate your concerns</li>\n \t<li>I can imagine how frustrated you must feel</li>\n \t<li>I hear what you are saying</li>\n \t<li>What would you like to see done?</li>\n \t<li>It’s okay to be angry</li>\n \t<li>Thank you for providing this information</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Suggested phrases to use for <i>de-escalating</i> a conversation, when the customer is very upset</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>We will do everything we can to help</li>\n \t<li>I apologize if you were misled or given incorrect information</li>\n \t<li>I’m not going to be able to help you if you’re this angry.

In order to have a complete and accurate record it is essential that all case activities be narrated. (Case activities include but are not limited to: Personal contacts, case reviews, process actions, accessing available databases such as PIEX or IABC.) Each time a case is accessed there must be a corresponding narrative that is factual, concise, accurate, and reflects all steps taken. Workers shall clearly narrate what database was accessed, why, and what relationship the party has to the case.\n\nBecause multiple people and offices may work on a case it is vital for workers to make sure narratives can be clearly understood. Narratives should not contain personal opinion. In rare instances, narratives may be subpoenaed and become part of a permanent court record.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Types of Narratives</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>System generated</li>\n \t<li>Worker entered</li>\n \t<li>Worker completed (system and worker)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Identification</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>All narratives will be ended with first initial and full last name of the worker making the entry.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Questions to Ask Yourself when Narrating</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n \t<li>Who are you talking to?</li>\n \t<li>What happened?</li>\n \t<li>On which case(s) does this narrative belong?\n\n<b>Case party has multiple cases</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Case parties may have more than one case, and may have different case roles on additional cases.

If so, add the narrative to the other cases.</li>\n \t<li>Narratives may be needed on cases where the party has the same role, and cases where the party does not have the same role.</li>\n \t<li>Examples of information that may need to be included on multiple cases are location and financial information.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Location information should be entered on <b>all</b> cases for the party, for <b>all</b> case roles.</li>\n \t<li>Contact with a NCP, and information provided regarding financial circumstances is information that should be entered on all cases where the case party is an obligor or alleged parent. If the NCP is a CP on another case, the financial information may also be important if there is any establishment or modification action in process.</li>\n \t<li>Use the ADDSUM and EMPSUM screens to identify additional cases needing narratives included.

Standardized narratives allow staff to easily find special narratives.</li>\n \t<li>Do not criticize another worker or office in your narrative. For example, do not use your narrative to address training issues or possible worker errors (i.e. missed calendar flags – refer to the flag, not to the fact it was missed).</li>\n \t<li>Corrections to narratives can only occur during the same business day as entered.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Appropriate Narration</b>\n\nThe right things to narrate:\n<ul>\n \t<li>When dealing with a customer who is verbally abusive, irate, or threatening, make sure to narrate exactly what you said.

Why? We have programs which use these comments for reports and when there is a special character included, the program ceases to run, causing problems for many of us.\n\nThe special characters that you <b>SHOULD NOT</b> use are ~ % ^ * &lt; &gt;\n\nThe @ and $ can be used, but not at the beginning of a sentence.\n\n<b>Addresses</b>\n\nYou may still use the % in place of c/o in addresses.\";i:1584644439019;s:17962:\"<b>What is an internal customer?</b>\n\nInternal customers are people who work with you inside your agency and rely on you for the services, products and information that they need to get their job done. They are not traditional customers, but they need the same caring attention that you provide to your external customers.\n\nThe customer service provider working at CSRU needs to remember that 66 percent of all costs for the services provided by CSRU are paid by the federal government (with few exceptions) and 34 percent is matched by the state. Thus various institutions, including the Governor’s office, Legislature (senators and representatives), DHS Director’s office, other state child support agencies – to name just a few – make up the portrait of CSRU’s internal customers.\n\nAlthough CSRU is one agency, it is made up of many different offices. This includes 18 field offices across the state, central office, operations, FCRU, CSC and EPICS. We are internal customers to each other and within our own offices.\n\nThe internal customer chain works both ways. Sometimes you are the customer and other times you are the service provider. For example, when a co-worker asks you for a printout or a report, you are the service provider because you are providing the co-worker with what is needed. Five minutes later you may go to the same co-worker and ask for help on a project; now you become the customer.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Giving good internal customer service</b>\n\nProviding excellent customer service requires good listening skills, ability to devote your complete attention to the customer, showing interest in what the customer is saying, being consistent in responses and finding the correct answers, and being friendly and compassionate. Whether talking to a customer in the interview room or talking to a co-worker, the rules of customer service remain the same and should be followed at all times.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>How to deal with the difficult internal customer</b>\n\nBe attentive and your voice calm and quiet. Listen to the internal customer and respond to their concerns. The same respect should be shown to an internal customer as an external customer. Explain what you can and can not address regarding their concerns. Keep the communication on a professional level and address only work issues. Inform them of options they may have and how to proceed with those options if you or someone else can not help them. If actions will be taken by you or directed to someone else, give the internal customer a timeline of when this will happen. (If possible summarize the conversation verbally or with an e-mail.)\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Internal Customers within the CSRU agency and how communication flows</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>From Central Office and Operations to Field Offices</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Red dots</b> – Red dots are defined as a written communication from a party to a governmental agency that requires a written response from CSRU. These are sent to the operations unit and they then forward to the respective field office for investigation and a written response. Red dots are normally faxed to the office and an e-mail is sent to the case resolution worker that it is coming to insure that it is received.

Prior to reporting to central office staff, the field should investigate the potential problem with their lead worker or supervisor.</li>\n \t<li><b>Policy Questions or Clarifications</b> – Field staff may have questions or need clarification from policy staff in central office on any process in child support. These questions are to be researched by field staff first to insure their concern has not already been addressed.

Do not send, reply to, or forward confidential information to anyone who should not get it. Use every precaution to make sure you send the email only to the intended recipients.\n\nAll information relating to clients is considered confidential. DHS is committed to protecting the confidentiality of its clients, and will therefore continue to pursue the highest level of data integrity of all confidential information through the use of reasonable and attainable data security products.\n<ul>\n \t<li>How to send messages containing confidential information:</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nE-Mail messages containing confidential information must include the following at the top of the message:\n\n\"THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES. UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE IS PROHIBITED.\"\n\n<b>Only use this statement when your email does contain confidential information.</b></li>\n \t<li><b>Sharing of Knowledge</b> – There are many times when a worker may get information or find a better way of doing something with child support processes or cases. Share this information with others in team meetings, with your supervisor and in staff meetings. If there is a question on policy or rules with the information, talk about this with your supervisor, lead worker, or attorney, after reviewing all accessible resources. This information should also be shared with the PIT Crew for that particular process.

This transfer may be for additional casework or review of case information. Make sure it is clearly noted in narratives or in a written note as to what needs to be done. Use your office policy to document where the case file is located; this might be narratives, or worker number notation. If you have a written notation on the case, make sure it is secure so that it does not become lost or fall off. Please see that the file is in order, and all documents tacked down before passing to another worker.

However, in some circumstances the person who contacted the legislator gave authorization to give information to the legislator, (example, grandparent wrote to legislator) but the grandparent does not have a ROI for the case.\n\nIn this situation, contact the case party the complaint is connected to (example - if payee’s mother wrote, contact payee) and discuss the concerns with the case party. Let the case party know we don’t have a ROI for the person who wrote, and ask the case party if we can release information to the person who made the complaint. If the case party says yes, tell the case party how to get a signed ROI to you quickly. If a ROI is received, contact the writer of the complaint as usual.\n\nIf a ROI is not received by the time you need to draft the written response, contact the letter writer and explain that you have spoken to the case party about the letter writer’s concerns, but you are not authorized to share confidential information with the letter writer. If providing general program information would be helpful and provide clarification, discuss processes in a generic sense with the letter writer.\n\n<b>Example 1</b> – Payor’s mother sends in a case concern to her senator with no ROI.

Tell the payor we also will not share information with the senator without the payor signing a release. If the payor says he does not want either party to have a release, proceed as follows:\n\nCall the payor’s mother and tell her you have talked to the payor about his child support case in response to the mother’s letter to the senator. However, explain that you cannot discuss details with the mother because she isn’t authorized by the payor to get confidential information about the case.\n\nWrite a letter containing similar information to the senator.\n\n<b>Example 2</b> – Payor’s mother writes to a legislator with no ROI.

CSRU attorneys have a separate set of professional standards to adhere to when a customer is (or may be) represented by legal counsel.</p>\n<p><b>Overview:</b> If an attorney represents a customer regarding child support matters, communication with CSRU about some issues must occur only with the customer’s attorney, who will then communicate with their client. The following guidance is intended to help non-attorney staff know when it is okay to communicate directly with the customer and how to do so appropriately.</p>\n<p>Sometimes customers have an attorney on retainer, or use a particular attorney when legal services are needed. In this situation a customer might make reference to “their attorney” but might not mean the attorney is representing them right now for a CSRU related issue.

If you are asked questions about these topics, refer the customer to their attorney to have their questions answered.</p>\n<p><b>You are still able to assist customers with their case if it is not directly related to topics for which they are represented by an attorney.

The payor calls their caseworker and says they want to fax pay-stubs to the field office to show their employer has started withholding, although payments will not be received prior to the court hearing.</p>\n<p>The payor is scheduled for a contempt hearing tomorrow and their attorney is out of town today.</p>\n<p>The payor wants their caseworker to call them to acknowledge the fax has been received.</p>\n<p><b>What should CSRU do?</b> Provide the customer with the office fax number, and then call the customer to let them know when the pay-stubs have been received.</p>\n<p><b>What should CSRU <i>NOT</i> do?</b> Explain to the customer what impact (if any) the pay-stubs may have on the outcome of the hearing.</p>\n<p><b>Example 2:</b> A new case is opened and CSRU is in the process of establishing an obligation against an alleged father. The AF is represented by an attorney for the establishment process. CSRU receives a request for genetic testing.</p>\n<p><b>What should CSRU do?</b> Make a CEC contact to the customer to explain that CSRU will be in communication with his attorney because he is represented, which includes sending all forms related to this particular process to the attorney exclusively. Then send the response to the request for GT to the attorney.</p>\n<p><b>What should CSRU <i>NOT</i> do?</b> Discuss the genetic testing request with the customer directly, as he is represented for this process.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> Do not assume a private attorney will be knowledgeable about CSRU’s procedures and expect the attorney to explain to the AF that CSRU will send all forms and other correspondence to the attorney instead of sending to the customer directly.</p></li>\n<li><p><b>How do I know for sure the customer is represented?</b> This is a determination driven by the customer. In general, if a customer says they are not represented, assume they are not. If the customer states they are represented, assume they are and discuss topics accordingly.</p>\n<p>If you have recent documentation indicating they are represented (such as narration or the ATTORNEY screen shows they are represented) assume the customer is represented unless the customer tells you differently.</p>\n<p>If a customer says they are not represented, but documentation in the case and on ICAR shows differently, ask the customer for clarification. Always narrate clearly if a customer tells you they are <b>not represented</b> when that conflicts with recent narratives, ICAR screens, or other direct information you have. This narration will support why you talked to the customer about topics you otherwise would not if they had an attorney. Also, ask the customer to provide a written statement saying they are no longer retaining an attorney for child support matters. It is not required that the customer provide the written statement, but still ask them to do so. Narrate that you made this request.</p></li>\n<li><p><b>What do I do if a customer does not have an attorney and they ask questions about legal processes, forms or other questions that have to do with the court or a legal action?</b></p>\n<p>Giving legal advice - While it is very important not to say anything to a customer that could be construed as legal advice, providing appropriate information about a process is good customer service. It can be difficult to determine the fine line between the two. In general, advice is giving a person direction on what they should or shouldn’t do. Information is based on facts and not opinion.</p>\n<p>Example – A payee asks if he/she should attend the court hearing on a contested Review action.</p>\n<p><b>What could CSRU staff say?</b> It is not <i>required</i> that you attend the hearing. Important decisions are made at those hearings, but you must decide for yourself if you are going to attend. If I talked to you about whether you should go, I would be giving you legal advice.</p>\n<p>The first 2 sentences provide factual information and are not giving advice.</p>\n<p><b>What CSRU staff should not say?</b> – You are not required to attend the hearing, but I suggest you go because important decisions are made at those hearings.</p>\n<p>Example – An alleged father has hired an attorney to represent him for the establishment process. The payee asks if she needs to hire an attorney.</p>\n<p><b>What could CSRU staff say?</b> It is not required that you hire an attorney. I will provide you information regarding the steps CSRU will take, the timeframes involved and what rights you have to contest an action or object to an outcome. You must make the decision as to whether you want to hire an attorney to advise you.</p>\n<p><b>What CSRU staff should not say?</b> – You are not required to hire an attorney. However, if he has one, I would hire one too if I was you.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The information summarized above will not fit every situation you encounter exactly. However, it will serve as a model to help determine the most appropriate course to take when confronted with questions about how to communicate with customers.</p>\";i:1584644528397;s:9725:\"<b>Contact Notations</b>\n\nContact notations are written records of <b>all</b> official business contacts with CSRU staff from legislators and their staff, Governor’s office staff, Ombudsman’s office staff, media (newspapers, radio, TV), legislative and governor’s office staff from other states, federal officials and congressional staff. (Contact notations do not need to be done in response to red dots). In addition, any other highly unusual contact with CSRU staff should be reported on a contact notation if it is believed that there may be significant repercussions from the contact.\n\nThese contact notations provide the Bureau Chief with a broad overview of customer concerns, including watching for trends in concerns statewide. These contact notations could lead to potential policy and process improvements.\n\nAs soon as possible, write the contact notation as a note in Outlook. The <b>Subject</b> is: <i>Contact Notation</i>. Address it to the distribution list found in the Outlook address book: <b>CSRU/CSRU Contact Notation</b> and copy your supervisor and regional administrator.\n\nHere is the format for the contact notation: The section below is written as if the contact will always be a call. In many instances it could be a response to an email.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Subject: Contact Notation</li>\n \t<li>First paragraph should indicate the name of contact, phone number and other identifying information about the caller, the date and time of the call</li>\n \t<li>Second paragraph should summarize the questions posed or issues raised by the caller</li>\n \t<li>Third paragraph should summarize the response provided</li>\n</ul>\nFinal paragraph should summarize, if needed, the follow-up actions and time frames needed to more fully address the questions or issues posed by the caller.\n\n<hr />\n\n<a href=\"http://dhssp/manual/subsite/Chapter4Reference/Iowa_Counties_and_Office_Info.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/excel.png\" /> <b>CSRU Telephone Directory</b></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<a href=\"https://secureapp.dhs.state.ia.us/customerweb/offices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>County DHS Field offices addresses</b></a>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Interpreters</b>\n\n<b>CTS LanguageLink</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/CustomerService/Contents/Resources/CTS%20LanguageLink/Instructions%20for%20Using%20CTS.doc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/word.png\" /> <b>Instructions for using CTS LanguageLink, and office account numbers</b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/CustomerService/Contents/Resources/CTS%20LanguageLink/Point%20to%20Your%20Language%20Poster.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/pdf.png\" /> <b>Point to Your Language poster</b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/CustomerService/Contents/Resources/CTS%20LanguageLink/CTS%20Tips%20&amp;%20Advice%20on%20Working%20With%20an%20Interpreter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/pdf.png\" /> <b>CTS Tips &amp; Advice on Working with Interpreters</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Telephone Language Translation and Sign Language Interpretation Services</b>\n\n<b>Telephone Language Translation Services</b>\n\n<b>Note:</b> CTS LanguageLink is the <b>only</b> authorized provider of telephone language interpretation services that you may use. <b>Effective 12/30/13, you may no longer use the AT&amp;T Language Line.</b>\n\nCTS LanguageLink provides both inbound and outbound calls requiring an interpreter.

CTS LanguageLink\'\'s IVR system allows a customer to quickly select the language desired for interpretation and be connected immediately to an interpreter without interaction with a live attendant. The benefit of this is an even faster connect time to your interpreter and better service to your limited English proficient (LEP) client.\n\n<b>What is a third party call?</b>\nA third party call is when you need CTS LanguageLink to call the LEP client and then bridge the call together with you and the interpreter.\n\n<b>How do I make a third party call with CTS LanguageLink?</b>\nIf you need a third party call, <b>press 9</b> (<i>even for Spanish</i>) to reach a Customer Service Representative (CSR) and let the operator know you need a third party call. We are happy to assist you with this at no additional charge. Our <i>interpreters are not able to make the third party call</i> directly.\n\n<b>I need another language other than the ones listed. How do I get my interpreter on the line?</b>\n<b>Press 9</b> for other languages and let the CSR know which language you require and they will connect you. If the language is unknown, you may reference the Point to your Language visual for help with most requested languages or ask a representative for assistance.\n\nContact Quality Assurance Team if you have any further questions:\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:qualityassurance@ctslanguagelink.com\" target=\"_blank:\"><b>qualityassurance@ctslanguagelink.com</b></a>\nToll Free: 1 (866) 610-1338\n\nTo ensure proper billing, it is important to identify your office location by entering the <b>Account Number</b> as follows:\n<ul>\n \t<li>CSRU - Western Region\nAcct #: 10066</li>\n \t<li>CSRU - Central Region\nAcct #: 10062</li>\n \t<li>CSRU - Des Moines Region\nAcct #: 10064</li>\n \t<li>CSRU - Eastern Region\nAcct #: 10065</li>\n \t<li>CSRU - Central Office\nAcct #: 10061</li>\n \t<li>CSRU - Collection Services Center\nAcct #: 10063</li>\n</ul>\nBy also entering your 10-digit telephone number (at the prompt), we can more accurately track individual offices\'\' use of CTS and more easily reconcile invoices.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Additional Tools</b>\n\nThis \"Point to Your Language\" poster is helpful if you have a customer in the office who requires translation assistance and you are unable to determine their needed language.\n\nThis \"Tips &amp; Advice\" document provides helpful information in working with an interpreter.\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/CustomerService/Contents/Resources/Language%20Line/Point%20to%20Your%20Language%20Poster.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/pdf.png\" /> <b>Point to Your Language</b></a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/CustomerService/Contents/Resources/Language%20Line/CTS%20Tips%20&amp;%20Advice%20on%20Working%20With%20an%20Interpreter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/02/pdf.png\" /> <b>Tips &amp; Advice</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Sign Language Interpretation Services</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.deafservices.iowa.gov/interpreting/list-of-interpreters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Deaf Services Commission of Iowa\'\'s website</b></a> (broken link) provides detailed information on obtaining sign language interpretation services, including a list of Iowa-licensed interpreters.\n\nTo find a sign language interpreter in your area, do the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>In the center of the page, under \'\'List of Interpreters in Iowa,\'\' click the link next to \'\'Listed via County\'\' to download the PDF file.</li>\n \t<li>The list is arranged by county #, listed in the first column in numerical order.</li>\n \t<li>Search for the appropriate county # (e.g., 77 for Polk Co.) to find those interpreters in your area.</li>\n \t<li>You may then call one or more interpreters to determine availability and cost.</li>\n</ul>\nNo matter which interpreter you decide to use, all that should be required for payment is a W-9 and invoice from the person.

Access to these records is crucial for the Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) to carry out its mission.  Federal and state law allows BHS to provide CSRU with necessary information.</p>\n<p>Beginning with BHS records filed on January 1, 1999, BHS sends two files to CSRU towards the end of each month. These files contain information about records the BHS added to their data base the previous month.  ICAR processes these files on the 3rd Friday of the month. By the middle of the next month, the BHS website reflects these files.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> If BHS adds a record to their database on February 2nd, ICAR matches with the record at the end of March, and workers can view the record on the BHS website by the middle of April.</p>\n<p>Please refer to <b>Non-Automated Location Sources - <a href=\"?page_id=1261\">Bureau of Health Statistics (BHS)</a></b> for more information about the BHS website.</p>\n<p>The marriage and death files from the Department of Public Health interface with the Iowa Collections and Reporting (ICAR) system to identify matches with child support case participants who are payors, alleged fathers, or payees.  The records in these files contain at least one social security number (SSN).</p>\n<p>If a match is found, ICAR automatically issues a narrative and a calendar flag to alert the CSRU worker to new information.

If there is a match between a BHS marriage file entry and an ICAR case participant, ICAR issues narrative (LOC 296) and calendar flag (LOC 103) to indicate a possible location source.  The narrative identifies the match by the individual’s name and SSN and informs you that the person has recently been married.</p>\n\n<p><b>Death Records</b></p>\n<p>If there is a match between a BHS death file entry and an ICAR case participant, ICAR will issue narrative LOC 366.  If there is not an existing date of death entry on the LOCATE or PAYEE2 screen, ICAR will issue calendar flag LOC 149.</p>\n<p>The match is made only on an individual’s social security number. Occasionally, the social security number from BHS is for a different person than who it matches with on ICAR.  We display the person’s name provided by BHS in the narrative and calendar flag. If the name is different than the case party’s, it may indicate the death information received is incorrect.  Refer to <a href=\"?page_id=1261\"><b>Reporting Errors In BHS Records</b></a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Effective December 22, 2005, ICAR stopped loading death information to the LOCATE and PAYEE2 screens. This allows you the opportunity to verify the information before ICAR stops enforcement processes and begins the case closure process.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Child Support Enforcement Network (CSENet)</h4>\n<p>CSENet is a national information system that automatically transmits child support enforcement information between states.  You can use CSENet quick locate (LO1) capability to request location information from other states.</p>\n<p>Initiate a quick locate request to the other state when you believe the non-custodial or custodial parent is in another state, have the locate person\'s SSN, but lack sufficient data to work the case. ICAR automatically processes the request and sends it to the other state by CSENet, if possible, or as a paper Locate Data Sheet (470/3475).</p>\n<p>To determine if a quick locate request will issue through CSENet or on paper, check the <a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/Intergovernmental/Contents/Resources/CSENET/CsenetAgreementTable.doc\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/04/word.png\"> <b>CSENet Agreement Tables</b></a> to see if Iowa has a quick locate agreement with other state.</p>\n<p><b>Best Practice TIP:</b></p>\n<p>Workers should set themselves a manual calendar flag 30 days from the date of the initial Quick Locate to check for a response from the other state.

An FVI is person, rather than case, specific and is coded on the FCR for the person identified as the victim of family violence. It does <b>not</b> identify the perpetrator. The person must be registered on the FCR in order for an FVI to be activated.</p>\n<p>In Iowa, the release-of-information procedures for an FVI are the same as that for a Disclosure Risk Indicator (DRI). Refer to chapter <a href=\"http://dhs.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/9-a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>9-A, GENERAL PROGRAM INFORMATION</b></a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Legal Reference</b></p>\n<p>§453(b)(2) of the Social Security Act</p>\n<p>Disclosure of FPLS information is prohibited if a state determines that it has \"reasonable evidence of domestic violence or child abuse and that disclosure of such information could be harmful to the parent or the child of such a parent.\"</p>\n<p>The definitions of \"domestic violence\" and \"child abuse,\" and the evidence required to support those definitions, vary from state to state. The determination to designate a person as associated with family violence depends upon state law and the procedures developed by that state.</p>\n\n<p><b>Implications of the FVI on FPLS Responses</b></p>\n<p>When an FVI is associated with a person, the FCR returns a code to the requesting state that says disclosure is prohibited because of the presence of an FVI. No additional information is returned. An FVI prevents all matching attempts and the FCR does not process requests to FPLS locate sources. In the event that an SSN is identified or corrected as part of an FPLS request, and the person has an FVI, the SSN is still returned to the requesting state.</p>\n<p> When an FVI is returned on a person, ICAR issues a narrative (CASE 368) and displays <span style=\"color: red;\">the appropriate victim code (CH, PE, P1, AF) in the</span> FVI field on the following screens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CASE</li>\n<li>PAYEE</li>\n<li>PAYOR</li>\n<li>NARRCASE</li>\n<li>PAYHIST</li>\n<li>INTERSTA</li>\n<li>ADDVER/CPADDVER</li>\n<li>PAYEMP</li>\n<li>EMPVER/CPEMPVER</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the screens displays the fvi field near the top of the screen.

PF16-Details.\" at the bottom of the screen, when someone is at risk.</p>\n\n<p><b>Removal of the FVI</b></p>\n<p> States <b>cannot</b> remove an FVI placed on an individual by another state. If more than one state has placed an FVI on the same person, the FCR releases no information until all states remove the FVI. When the FVI is removed by all states, FCR again accepts and processes FPLS requests for that person. ICAR issues a narrative (CASE 371) to inform the worker of the FVI removal. An FVI is set strictly by the FCR and cannot be removed unless an automated update from the FCR does so.</p>\";i:1585941999420;s:1312:\"<p>FPLS responses received on an obligor/alleged father must pass certain criteria before being loaded to ICAR.

Once that person turns 65 years old, ICAR automatically enters a \"Y\" in the ssr field and places an \"N\" in the ssd field.</p>\n<p>A case participant who receives SSID may be over 65 years old if the participant was a \"Disabled Individual\" or \"Disabled Child\" prior to turning 65 years old. If a case participant was not disabled or stopped receiving SSID benefits before turning 65 years old, the participant may receive SSIR as an \"Aged Individual\". Therefore, you cannot enter \"Y\" at the same time in the ssir and ssid fields.</p>\n<p>A case participant may receive both Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability, so you can enter a \"Y\" in both the ssid and ssd fields.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\";i:1586183955570;s:859:\"<ul>\n<li>The entries on the FEDBEN screen trigger updates to the ssd (y/n/r) and ssi (y/n/r) fields on the IWO2 screen for <a href=\"\"><b><i>hardship</i></b></a> purposes.</li>\n<li>The federal benefits field entries on the PAYEE2 and LOCATE screens and the fed ben field on the CHILD screen are based on the corresponding fields on the FEDBEN screen. A \"Y\" displays if any of the benefit fields on FEDBEN displays a \"Y\" for the person. You cannot change these entries on the PAYEE2, LOCATE and CHILD screens.</li>\n<li>ICAR automatically updates the LOCDB and the FEDBEN screens when we receive benefit information from the FCR. Review the LOCDB screens to verify the information is for the correct person. You can also find additional information on LOCDB regarding the case participant\'s benefit amount, address information, prison status, etc.</li>\n</ul>\";}"

Information available through VRT includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name and address of the individual who registered the vehicle,</li>\n<li>The date of registration and renewal,</li>\n<li>A description of the vehicle, including type (i.e. auto, mobile home, truck, etc.),</li>\n<li>The status of the registration,</li>\n<li>Name, DOB, and address, including the mailing address of the individual,</li>\n<li>The issuance and expiration date of the driver\'s license,</li>\n<li>The driver\'s license number and customer number, and</li>\n<li>The status of the driver\'s license.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Dept. of Transportation information (VRT, and AUTOLOCIDOT) is subject to special confidentiality regulations.

To search by FEIN, see <b>Viewing the Employer Maintenance File</b>.</p>\n<p>Most workers search by employers by name, either using VEMPLOY, or by pressing F6 on an EMPVER screen to access the Employer Name Address Search screen.</p>\n<p>When you search for an employer by name, ICAR displays the results in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>You may have trouble finding the employer for a number of reasons, most often because your format for the name does not match the name in the file.</p>\n<p>The following tips may help you find the employer:</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> Use the F7 and F8 keys to move forward and back through the results screens.</p>\n<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>When you search for an employer, ICAR displays the best match it can identify.</p>\n<p>However, punctuation differences, unusual spellings, or slight differences in the name of the company can cause problems, especially if the original employer record is old and does not conform to current standards.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>You hear the obligor works for McGee’s Construction.</p>\n<p>You enter MCGEE’S CONSTRUCTION on EMPVER and press F6 to search the employer maintenance file. ICAR displays a list of employers beginning with \"McGee’s Dutch Mill.\"</p>\n<p>When you press F7, you see the employer listed as MCGEE CONSTRUCTION.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> Search for the employer under an alternate name or spelling.</p>\n<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>If an employer name can be spelled different ways, try looking under each spelling.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>You hear the obligor works for McMillan Oil.</p>\n<p>You enter MCMILLAN OIL on EMPVER and press F6.</p>\n<p>You do not see the employer, so you press CLEAR to return to EMPVER.</p>\n<p>You enter MAC MILLAN OIL as the employer name and press F6. The employer is listed as MAC MILLAN OIL.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> Search for the employer under both the legal and common name.</p>\n<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>ICAR Maintenance staff attempt to list employers under names that you’ll be able to find. However, they may not always be able to list an employer under a common name.</p>\n<p>If you find the employer under a legal name, notify the ICAR Maintenance staff. They will update the listing to make the employer easier for other workers to find.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>You hear the obligor works for Carl’s Place. You search the employer maintenance file under CARL’S PLACE and CARLS PLACE but cannot find the employer.</p>\n<p>In talking to the employer, you find out the legal name for the business is actually AG ENTERPRISES, which is how the business is listed on ICAR.</p>\n<p>You send the common business name to the ICAR Maintenance team. They update the employer name on the record.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> When searching for a chain store or restaurant, add a character to the end of the name if you want to look at the end of the list.</p>\n<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>Certain chain stores and restaurants may have many records in ICAR—one for each location. ICAR displays these records alphabetically by the city.</p>\n<p>If you want a store towards the end of the list, it may be faster for you to work your way from the last employer location rather than the first.</p>\n<p>When you change the last letter of the employer name or add a character to the end, ICAR displays the next business.</p>\n<p>Use the F7 key to work your way backward through the list.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>You want to find a Wal-Mart in Waterloo. You could enter WALMART, but then you would have to page through all the locations to get to Waterloo’s listing.</p>\n<p>Instead, you enter WALMARTX to start your search. When ICAR displays the first business with a listing after this spelling, you press F7 to see last of the Wal-Mart locations.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> When an employer name has components that can be \"spelled\" as words or symbols, look under the name both ways.</p>\n<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>If an employer has numbers (such as 13 or five) or special symbols (such as \"+\"), look for the employer using both symbols and words.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>If you can’t find A+ HARDWARE, look under A PLUS HARDWARE.</p>\n<p>If you can’t find THIRTEENTH STREET CAFE, look under 13TH STREET CAFE.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> Use the employer address to confirm a match.</p>\n<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>Employers sometimes have many different locations listed on the employer maintenance file. Use the addresses to confirm if you are selecting the correct employer.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>You are looking for a McDonald’s at 30th and Forest in Des Moines.

Do not look for an exact match. Instead, compare the addresses, the names, or the phone numbers.</p>\n<p>You can use the Employer Summary (EMPSUM) screen to quickly review several employer records at the same time.</p>\n<p>If the employer is already verified on the case, verify the new employer record with an \"N\" in the emp verified field.</p>\n</li>\n<li><b>Checking the employer maintenance file</b>\n<p>If the employer is not already verified on the case, attempt to find the employer on the employer maintenance file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press F6 from the EMPVER/CPEMPVER screen to access the employer list.</li>\n<li>If you don’t find the employer on the first page, use the F7 and F8 keys to move forward and back through the list.</li>\n<li>Search carefully as the business name on ICAR may vary from the new record. For example, the EMPVER screen may show the employer name of Nacho Inc., but ICAR lists the employer as Nacho Mexican Restaurant.<br />\nIf you find the actual employer on the employer maintenance file, do the following:</li>\n<li>If the employer record is from a non-automated source, verify the record with an \"N\" and create a new employer record with the correct information.</li>\n<li>If the employer record is from an automated source, press F15 to copy the record. From the new record, press F6 and select the correct employer from the employer maintenance file.<br />\nFollowing these instructions ensures ICAR will not load the payroll processor information in the future and records the correct information.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><b>Checking other sources</b>\n<p>If the employer is not already verified and not on the employer maintenance file, attempt to find the actual employer location, name, and address. Sources for this information may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phone books and reverse telephone lookup: The employer records often contain the employer’s actual phone number.</li>\n<li>The payroll processor company: If the phone number belongs to the payroll processing company, they may be able to give you the correct employer name.</li>\n<p>If you find the actual employer information, enter it by typing over the existing data in the EMPLOYER NAME, ADDRESS LINE 1, ADDRESS LINE 2, CITY/STATE/ZIP, and PHONE NUMBER fields. If the employer is from an automated source, press F15 to make a copy of the record first, then type over the existing data in the copy.</p>\n<p>If you are not able to find the actual location, verify the employer with an \"N.\"</p>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>F15 Copy Function</h4>\n<p>If an automated source loads an improperly formatted employer to the EMPVER screen and the employer is not in the Employer Maintenance File, you must copy the employer to a new EMPVER screen to reformat the employer and verify it. All employers not in the Employer Maintenance File that ICAR loads to EMPVER screens from automated sources display a \'Y\' in the AUTO SOURCE field.</p>\n<p>ICAR displays blanks in the AUTO SOURCE field for all employers loaded to the EMPVER screen from automated sources if the employers are in the Employer Maintenance File. You cannot perform the F15 Copy function to reformat these employers. Only Central Office staff adds, modifies, or deletes employers from the Employers listed in the Employer Maintenance File.</p>\n<p>After verifying that an employer loaded by an automated source is improperly formatted, press F15 (Shift & F3) to copy that employer to a new EMPVER screen. ICAR transfers everything to the new EMPVER screen except the information below the phone number/ext fields. ICAR also enters the current date in the DATE address entered field and enters a \'C\' in the autosource field to indicate this is a copied employer received from an automated source that was improperly formatted.</p>\n<p>ICAR issues a narrative (EVER 13) to record the F15 copy.</p>\n<p>You can now modify the necessary address fields. The following fields are protected from modification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DATE ADDRESS ENTERED</li>\n<li>DATE OF ADDRESS</li>\n<li>AUTOSOURCE</li>\n<li>SOURCE OF EMP</li>\n<li>FEDERAL ID</li>\n<li>EMPLOYER ID</li>\n<li>BYP EMP</li>\n<li>UIB/WAGE fields</li>\n<li>NMBA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After you reformat the employer, press F2 to add the properly formatted employer to the case. When you press F2 to add the newly formatted employer to the case, ICAR enters an \'N\' and the current date to the emp verified and date verifd fields on the original EMPVER screen that contains the improperly formatted employer. ICAR also changes the \'Y\' in the autosource field to an \'F\' to indicate the employer loaded by an automated source was copied for improper formatting.</p>\";i:1586527903062;s:657:\"<p>When you add an employer to EMPVER/CPEMPVER, enter the local address where the person actually works.</p>\n<p>If the employer requests the Unit send IWOs to a different address or include special information in the IWO address (such as contact information), e-mail the IWO address to <a href=\"mailto:rfee@dhs.state.ia.us\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Roger Fee</b></a> when you verify the employer.</p>\n<p>If the company is a sole proprietorship and the company name begins with a proper full name, use the proper last name in the company name, but include the proper full name in the IWO address.</p>\n<p><b>Examples</b></p>\n[ninja_tables id=\"1425\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\";i:1586533974723;s:2535:\"<p>ICAR displays the EMPLOYER NAME ADDRESS SEARCH screen when you press PF6 on the EMPVER screen.

If you are in doubt about what to do, please consult with your office’s attorney.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</b></p>\n<p>The purpose of the chapter 7 bankruptcy is the straight liquidation of debts. It is designed for debtors in financial difficulty who do not have the ability to pay their existing debts. All non-exempt property owned by the debtor as of the date of filing of the petition is applied by the bankruptcy trustee to pay the creditors’ claims. The duration of the bankruptcy plan is short - generally 90 to 120 days from the filing of the petition.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> A debtor may initially file a chapter 7 bankruptcy which can then be converted to a chapter 13 proceeding. The reverse is also true - a chapter 13 proceeding can be converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy. The conversion from one plan to another does not reinstate the stay if previous relief from the stay was received.</p>\n<p>The creditor should receive a notice of the chapter 7 filing and notice of whether a claim should be filed or not. No claim is to be filed if there are no assets.</p>\n<p>Generally, there is no need for CSRU to file a proof of claim since support obligations are nondischargeable and given the shortness of the bankruptcy plan. Any questions or concerns should be addressed to the office attorney.</p>\n<p>A chapter 7 bankruptcy can be filed by a debtor only once every seven years.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</b></p>\n<p>This bankruptcy chapter is designed for debt relief for a business reorganization or for an individual with debts which exceed the chapter 13 limitations.</p>\n<p>Complete and file the claim with attachments (copy of all orders and pay records) with the bankruptcy clerk of court for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Do not file a claim when there is no balance on the case.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 12 Bankruptcy</b></p>\n<p>This bankruptcy chapter is designed to allow family farmers and fishermen to repay their debts from future earning over a period of time. A chapter 12 bankruptcy is similar to a chapter 13 bankruptcy, but the eligibility requirements are restrictive, limiting its use to family farmers or commercial fishermen.</p>\n<p>Chapter 7, 11, and 13 bankruptcies can be recorded on the bankruptcy & chaptr field on the PAYOR screen. However, the chapter 12 bankruptcy should be treated as a 13 action. The payor field should show it as a 13 filing; however, a narrative should be entered confirming that this particular action is actually a 12 filing.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</b></p>\n<p>This bankruptcy option is available to debtors with regular income and whose total debts do not exceed certain dollar amounts set forth in the bankruptcy code.</p>\n<p>In this type of bankruptcy the debtor makes regular payments to the bankruptcy trustee during the life of the plan, which generally lasts as long as 24 to 60 months. The trustee then makes the actual payment to the creditors.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> In most cases, the plan will be funded by payments from future wages earned or other income received by the debtor. Occasionally, however, the plan will be funded by the sale of real estate, for example, with the proceeds going to the trustee to distribute to the various creditors.</p>\n<p>Complete and file the claim with attachments (copy of all orders and pay records) with the bankruptcy clerk of court for chapter 13 bankruptcy. Do not file a claim when there is no balance on the case.</p>\n<p>Unlike chapter 7 proceedings, which can be filed only once every seven years, a debtor can file serial chapter 13 proceedings.</p>\";i:1586783587052;s:2242:\"<ul>\n<li><b>Process:</b> ENF</li>\n<li><b>Number:</b> 14</li>\n<li><b>Priority:</b> High</li>\n<li><b>Text:</b> BANKRUPTCY CLAIM IS PENDING.

(A chapter 11 debtor usually proposes a plan of reorganization to keep its business alive and pay creditors over time. People in business or individuals can also seek relief in chapter 11.)<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Chapter 12:</b> This chapter of the bankruptcy code provides for adjustment of debts of a \"family farmer,\" or a \"family fisherman\" as those terms are defined in the bankruptcy code.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Chapter 13:</b> This chapter of the bankruptcy code provides for the adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income. (Chapter 13 allows a debtor to keep property and pay debts over time, usually three to five years.)<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Claim:</b> A creditor\'s assertion of a right to payment from the debtor or the debtor\'s property.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Creditor:</b> One to whom the debtor owes money or who claims to be owed money by the debtor.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Debtor:</b> A person who has filed a petition for relief under the bankruptcy code.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Discharge:</b> A release of a debtor from personal liability for certain dischargeable debts set forth in the bankruptcy code. A discharge releases a debtor from personal liability for certain debts known as dischargeable debts and prevents the creditors owed those debts from taking any action against the debtor to collect the debts. The discharge also prohibits creditors from communicating with the debtor regarding the debt, including telephone calls, letters, and personal contact.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Domestic Support Obligation (DSO):</b> All debts that are owed to or recoverable by a spouse, child, guardian, responsible relative, or government unit and that are in the nature of alimony, maintenance or support (including public assistance), entered by a court or government unit. A DSO does not include debt “assigned to a nongovernmental entity, unless it was assigned voluntarily…solely for the purpose of collecting the debt.”<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><b>Exemptions/Exempt Property:</b> Certain property owned by an individual debtor that the bankruptcy code or applicable state law permits the debtor to keep from unsecured creditors. For example, in some states the debtor may be able to exempt all or a portion of the equity in the debtor\'s primary residence (homestead exemption), or some or all \"tools of the trade\" used by the debtor to make a living (i.e., auto tools for an auto mechanic or dental tools for a dentist). The availability and amount of property the debtor may exempt depends on the state the debtor lives in.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Liquidation:</b> A sale of a debtor\'s property with the proceeds to be used for the benefit of creditors.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Nondischargeable Debt:</b> A debt that cannot be eliminated in bankruptcy. Examples include a home mortgage, certain taxes, debts for most government funded or guaranteed educational loans or benefit overpayments, debts arising from death or personal injury caused by driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and debts for restitution or a criminal fine included in a sentence on the debtor\'s conviction of a crime. Some debts, such as debts for money or property obtained by false pretenses and debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity may be declared nondischargeable only if a creditor timely files and prevails in a nondischargeability action.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Priority:</b> The bankruptcy code\'s statutory ranking of unsecured claims that determines the order in which unsecured claims will be paid if there is not enough money to pay all unsecured claims in full.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Proof of Claim:</b> A written statement and verifying documentation filed by a creditor that describes the reason the debtor owes the creditor money. (There is an official form for this purpose.)<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Property of the Estate:</b> All legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property become the property of the bankruptcy estate and will be distributed to the debtor’s creditors.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Secured Debt:</b> Debt backed by a mortgage, pledge of collateral, or other lien; debt for which the creditor has the right to pursue specific pledged property upon default. Examples include home mortgages, auto loans and tax liens.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Trustee:</b> The representative of the bankruptcy estate who exercises statutory powers, principally for the benefit of the unsecured creditors, under the general supervision of the court and the direct supervision of the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator. The trustee is a private individual or corporation appointed in all chapter 7, chapter 12, and chapter 13 cases and some chapter 11 cases. The trustee\'s responsibilities include reviewing the debtor\'s petition and schedules and bringing actions against creditors or the debtor to recover property of the bankruptcy estate. In chapter 7, the trustee liquidates property of the estate, and makes distributions to creditors. Trustees in chapter 12 and 13 have similar duties to a chapter 7 trustee and the additional responsibilities of overseeing the debtor\'s plan, receiving payments from debtors, and disbursing plan payments to creditors.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>U.S. Trustee:</b> An officer of the Justice Department responsible for supervising the administration of bankruptcy cases, estates, and trustees; monitoring plans and disclosure statements; monitoring creditors\' committees; monitoring fee applications; and performing other statutory duties.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <a href=\"http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><b>http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx</b></a><p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> House Report 109-031, Part 1, Subtitle B.

See <a href=\"http://dhssp/csr/projects/efiling/attorneyworkgroup/Shared%20Documents/Signature%20examples%20per%20Chapter%2016%20Rules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/04/sharepoint.png\"> <b>Signature Examples per Chapter 16 Rules</b></a> (a handout provided at Attorney Training on Chapter 16 Rules presented by the Iowa Judicial Branch).</li>\n<br />\n<li><b>UETA and Iowa Code § 602.1614</b><br />\nIowa, like nearly every other state, has enacted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). Iowa’s version of UETA is found in Iowa Code chapter 554D. The primary goal of UETA is to make electronic records and signatures legally equivalent to their paper counterparts.<br />\nUnder UETA, an electronic signature generally has the same legal effect as a “wet ink” signature. A “signature shall not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” Iowa Code § 554D.108(1). “If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature satisfies the law.” Iowa Code § 554D.108(4). The definition of “electronic signature” in the e-filing rules mirrors the definition under UETA. Compare Iowa Ct. R. 16.201 and Iowa Code § 554D.103(8). The e-filing rules provide clear authority for CSRU to file documents containing electronic signatures.</li>\n<br />\n<li><b>Electronic signatures in non-e-filing counties</b><br />\nIn contrast to e-filing counties, which are covered by the e-filing rules, it does not appear that the court has issued rules specifically addressing a litigant’s use of electronic signatures in a non-e-filing county. Thus, by implication, an argument could be made that the Iowa Supreme Court has not authorized the use of electronic records or signatures in non-e-filing counties. It is recommended that CSRU not file documents with electronic signatures in non-e-filing counties at this time.</li>\n<br />\n<li><b>Oaths, Affirmation of Verifications</b><br />\nDocuments requiring oaths, affirmations or verifications “may be either signed nonelectronically and scanned…or may be signed by an electronic process which accurately reproduces…the required signature.” Iowa Court Rule 16.306(3). Electronic notarization is specifically authorized in UETA. See Iowa Code § 554D.113. Note, though, that electronic notarization likely requires some special steps. For instance, in Iowa before a notary can notarize an electronic document, he or she has to select a tamper-evident technology and must notify the Secretary of State as to the selected technology. See Iowa Code § 9B.20.</li>\n<br />\n<li><b>Multiples Signatures</b><br />\nIowa Court Rule 16.306(5)(a) states that “[b]y filing the document the registered filer confirms that the content of the document is acceptable to all persons signing the document and all such persons consent to having their signatures appear on the document, and that the registered filer has notified the other signatories to the document that they must be registered filers for their signatures to be valid. Signatures on documents filed by governmental agencies… will be presumed valid, even if the signatory is not a registered filer.” (emphasis added).</li>\n</ul>\";i:1586789559336;s:1188:\"<p><b>The problem:</b> With the sheer number of Event Codes that are available on CSeF, there is frequently more than one Code that can be used for any particular document that is filed. If the wrong Event Code is used, the Clerk of Court will likely reject your filing. By and large, though, if you use an Event Code that makes sense, and if the Clerk is fine with the Code you are using, then you shouldn’t worry too much as to whether the Code you are using is the CORRECT Code.</p>\n<p><b>The solution:</b> Below are links to Event Codes that you should and should not use.

However, the individual attorney will be linked to the case and will need to later withdraw.

In other words, if the Clerk of Court indexes a party or an attorney to a particular case, then that individual will receive an emailed NEF every time there is a filing in that case.</p>\n<p><b>The problem:</b> In the beginning of electronic filing, there was no consistency as to whether Clerks of Court offices would index a CSRU attorney or a CSRU office or both to a particular case. It was quickly determined that individual CSRU attorneys should not be indexed to cases as this would result in a flood of email NEF’s, and it could cause problems when that particular attorney left the warm comfort of government employment.</p>\n<p><b>The solution:</b> CSRU conferred with the judicial branch, which in turn sent the following memo to all Clerks of Court offices – </p>\n<ul>\n<p><b>DATE:</b> March 6, 2013<br />\n<b>FROM:</b> Betty Buitenwerf<br />\n<b>RE:</b> Indexing CSRU to Cases</p>\n<p>CSRU attorneys do not need to be indexed to cases if they are filing through the CSRU interface (CSeF). On filings from CSeF in clerk review, the filer will display as the individual CSRU office (for example Sioux City, Spencer, etc.).</p>\n<p>In the event a CSRU atty needs to be indexed to a case, the atty will file through the Filer\'s Interface (eFlex), the filer will show as the attorney name, NOT the CSRU office name, and the clerk can then index the attorney as ATCS - Attorney for CSRU. It will not be necessary to link ATCS to the CSRU office on the Litigant screen in ICIS, as this will mean BOTH the atty and CSRU get notifications AND the documents filed.</p>\n<p>This is a bit of a departure from the standard process when other attorneys are indexed on a case. The reason for this comes down to notifications. When the CSRU office is notified, the documents are also sent to CSeF, and then ultimately their internal document storage/management system. Unless the atty files using their eFlex account, only the CSRU office will be indexed. This includes administrative orders, etc.</p>\n</ul>\n<p><b>What This Means For You:</b> Individual attorneys should not be indexed to cases unless they file on that case through EFLEX (the Court’s electronic filing interface). If your Clerk of Court questions you on this, refer them to the above memo. If you are indexed to a case individually and don’t want to be, you will probably need to file a motion and proposed order to withdraw from that case, though check with your Clerks of Court office because some offices will just de-index you at your request.  NOTE: if you are indexed to a case and a CSRU office is not, you need to make sure that an office gets indexed when you withdraw. Otherwise, nobody will receive the NEFS. Here is an example of a withdrawal that addresses both issues:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/04/IN-THE-IOWA-DISTRICT-COURT-FOR-COUNTY-COUNTY.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/04/IN-THE-IOWA-DISTRICT-COURT-FOR-COUNTY-COUNTY2.png\" /></p>\";i:1586789560421;s:2438:\"<p>Effective 3/7/15, JB added a Terms of Service web portal to its JB Guest wi-fi access.

This exception allows for CSRU to destroy the original e-filed document after making “an unaltered image or reproduction of the original document.” This applies <b>ONLY</b> to e-filed documents.</p>\n<p><b>Direction provided by CSRU (pursuant to an email from Joe Finnegan dated October 2, 2014) as to record retention:</b></p>\n<p>Based on Iowa Code section 252B.17A (CSRU\'s imaging statute), follow these document retention procedures (effective immediately):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For documents filed in a converted (e-filing) court county, retain all originals for 30 days after the document is imaged and indexed. This ensures the original is available should there be issues with the imaged copy. After 30-days, follow standard office procedures for document destruction.</li>\n<li>If a customer requests a copy of an e-filed document which was e-filed by CSRU, print a copy of the file-stamped version of the document from PODS and provide the copy to the customer.</li>\n<li>If a customer requests a copy of an e-filed document that was not e-filed by CSRU, suggest the customer obtain the copy from the courts. If the customer rejects this suggestion, provide the copy if it is available from PODS as long as CSRU is authorized to do so*. Also notify central office of this request using the CSRU - CSEF email address. This allows us to evaluate these situations and determine if additional instructions or changes to this policy are needed.</li>\n<p><b>*Note:</b> CSRU is not allowed to provide documents from confidential (sealed) court files. Some examples of confidential filings are terminations of parental rights, juvenile custody court orders, and temporary child support orders in dissolution files, if the court has not yet entered a final dissolution decree.</p>\n</ul>\n<p>For non-e-filed documents, continue to follow your offices procedures for the retention of paper documents.</p>\";i:1586789562022;s:1916:\"<p>Efiling rules make redaction of certain information mandatory.

Do not make redactions on an original document. Make a photocopy of the original, then manually redact the information on the photocopy using a black marker. Lastly, make another photocopy so that no information can be read through the black marker.</li>\n<li>Electronically redact, then print the document and rescan the redacted version.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do not use the viewer in G360 to redact. Though it may appear that the tools are redacting the confidential information, the redaction layer is stripped when the document is called to CSeF and the confidential information is exposed.</p>\n<p>If you have to redact any confidential information on a document which the law requires you to file the original copy, you need to include Form 470-4412 (“In lieu of” form) as the first page of each document that was redacted. In the past, you may have included only one Form 470-4412 for each packet you were filing. With efiling, you must include this form for each document. For example, if you have 2 financial statements that are redacted, you will include Form 470-4412 twice, once with each financial statement.</p>\n<p>When the documents with the redactions are scanned into PODS, users should attach form 470-4412 at that time and save the document as the appropriate CSRU document name, then add “redacted” in the Notes field.</p>\";i:1586789562265;s:918:\"<p>When initiating a registration, CSRU must submit the notice of registration using the event code “civil original notice” in order to obtain the COC signature page. An original notice is <b>not</b> docketed in the court file. Therefore, the notice of registration does not show on ICIS and is not available to view on Iowa Courts Online.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of the notice of registration back from COC with the clerk’s signature page, CSRU will send for service. Once both parties are served and CSRU is ready to present the proposed order confirming registration, CSRU will prepare the efiling packet and include a proposed order confirming registration, the returns of service, and the clerk-signed notice of registration using the event code “notice.” The COC will docket the notice of registration along with the returns of service and it will be available for viewing on Iowa Courts Online.</p>\n\n\n\";i:1586789562545;s:1236:\"<p><b>The problem:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>When a Clerk of Court office rejects a filing that you made through CSeF, you will receive the packet back on your CSeF Home page, and the status will indicate that it is rejected.</li>\n<li>BUT when a judge rejects one of your <b>proposed orders</b>, this rejection will NOT come back to the CSeF Home page. Instead, the judge MAY send an email through their EFLEX system to inform you why the proposed order is being rejected.</li>\n<li>Since the case in question is likely linked to the CSRU office instead of to the attorney (see - INDEXING OR LINKING TO CASES), if a judge sends an email rejection, it will go <b>to that CSRU office’s email account</b> and you will have to wait for the keeper of that account to forward the notification to you. This can be problematic if you are dealing with a time-sensitive issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>The solution:</b> there isn’t one. CSRU has mentioned this issue to the Judicial Branch, and they may address it in the future. In the meantime, be aware of the issue, make sure that you keep track of the proposed orders that you file, and make sure that the keeper of your office’s email account forwards rejection emails to you as soon as possible.</p>\";i:1586789562795;s:443:\"<p>The NEFs sent out with each document received by the COC have a section on them indicating which parties received notice of the document by the courts auto-notification systems, and which parties were not served by EDMS.

Because an entry in the OTHERfield stops the Medsum program from attempting to enforce health insurance through the payor’s employer, the OTHERfield has also become a “work around” for orders that contain health insurance language that CSRU is unable to enforce. This page describes the situations in which the OTHERfield can be used as a “work around.” Refer to the “Entries to make on ICAR when using the “OTHER” field” section at the bottom of this page for the specific ICAR entries.</p>\n\n<p><b>No Party Ordered to Enroll the Child(ren)</b></p>\n<p>Some orders explain how the expense of a policy will be divided or the circumstances under which someone is to provide the coverage, but do not specifically identify the party ordered to enroll the child(ren).

CSRU does not have to attempt to determine the meaning of “the most reasonable insurance cost.”</i></p>\n\n<p><b>“Either Party” Ordered to Enroll the Child(ren)</b></p>\n<p>When “either party,” “either parent,” or “whichever party,” is ordered to enroll the child(ren), CSRU cannot enforce the order.

Other sentences in the order may clarify the meaning of phrases like “either party.” If other language in the order clarifies when a specific party is ordered to enroll the children, do not use the OTHER field when entering the order on the HIUPDATE screen.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> The In-Depth Medical Training material from 2007 and part of 2008 contained an example which instructed workers to consider an order stating “either party” was ordered to provide health insurance as an order requiring both parents to provide health insurance.

The plan administrator enrolls the child in the employment-related health insurance plan. The payor wants or has enrolled the child in another plan (e.g., private plan, policy through the payor’s new spouse’s employer, payee-provided <i>hawk-i</i>, etc.).</p>\n<p>We may learn of this situation through a variety of sources, e.g., the payor may call or stop by the local office or the payor’s employer may call EPCIS.</p>\n<p><b>Steps to determine whether health insurance is comparable:</b></p>\n<p><b>Step 1:</b> Tell the person (payor, employer, etc.) that state law requires the employer to receive proof that the other health insurance policy is comparable to the employment-related policy before they can end enrollment.

EPICS has received numerous referrals from CSRU offices in the past few months when a payor complained that the employer enrolled the children in a plan that exceeds the ordered premium limit. Do not make a referral to EPICS in this situation. The procedure to follow when an employer overlooks an ordered premium limit is explained below.</p>\n\n<p><b>How Employers are Informed of a Premium Limit</b></p>\n<p>An entry in the REAS COST or TOTAL COST field on the HIUPDATE screen causes the appropriate premium limit information to print on form 470/3818, <i>National Medical Support Notice (NMSN)</i>. When there is no entry in the REAS COST or TOTAL COST fields, language will print on the NMSN stating that there is no premium limit in the order. Employers can find this “Exception” language in bold print at the bottom of page 1 of Part A.</p>\n<p>For additional information about the REAS COST and TOTAL COST fields or the “Exception” language on the <i>NMSN</i>, see <a href=\"file://hoovr3s2/CSRU.772/CSRUPROC/Directives/2009\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/04/folder.png\"> <b>Procedural Directive #09-11, DRA of 2005 – Changes to NMSN and HIUPDATE Screen</b></a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>EPICS Receives the NMSN</b></p>\n<p>When an employer returns policy information with the <i>NMSN</i>, EPICS enters the policy information on the MEDICAL screen.

Point out that the <i>NMSN</i> already included the information about the ordered premium limit.</li>\n<li>If the children are enrolled in a plan that exceeds the premium limit:</li>\n<li>Explain that the employer does not need any additional notice from CSRU to disenroll the child(ren) since doing so is in compliance with the premium limit information already provided on the <i>NMSN</i>.</li>\n<li>If the cost of another plan is within the ordered premium limit, ask the employer to enroll the child(ren) in that plan. Follow up with the employer to obtain the policy information and enter it on the MEDICAL screen.</li>\n<li>If the employer will need to disenroll the child(ren), ask the employer for the date the coverage will end and enter the date in the END DATE field on the MEDICAL screen.</li>\n<li>If the REAS COST and TOTAL COST fields were NOT entered correctly, fix the entries and take the following steps.\n<ul>\n<li>Manually generate form 470-3818, <i>NMSN</i>, and form 470-2743, <i>Employer Medical Support Information</i>, from FORMVIEW.

If an NMSN was not sent recently and you are unsure if one needs to be sent now, contact the <a href=\"mailto:CSRUPolMed@dhs.state.ia.us\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Medical team</b></a>.</p>\n<li>Contact the employer.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Explain the premium limit.</li>\n<li>Tell the employer you are sending an updated <i>NMSN</i>.</li>\n<li>If the employer will need to disenroll the child(ren), ask the employer for the date the coverage will end and enter the date in the END DATE field on the MEDICAL screen.</li>\n<li>If the child(ren) is currently enrolled in a plan that is within the ordered premium limit, make sure the plan is entered on the MEDICAL screen. Ask the employer to respond to the updated <i>NMSN</i> as they normally would.</li>\n<li>If the child(ren) is enrolled in a plan that exceeds the premium limit, but another plan is available that does not exceed the premium limit, ask the employer to enroll the child(ren) in that plan.

Those two questions are copied below.</p>\n<p>3. <b>At what point will EPICS not pursue medical? For example, on the cases where it is ordered that the premium cannot cost anything and the employer gives us a premium amount over the cost of single coverage, do we automatically update to NOT send the NMSN during the EMPVER process, or only if HI POT “A” runs?</b></p>\n<p>In this case situation, do not make an entry on the EMPVER screen to signify an employer doesn’t have health insurance. When working a HI POT of “A” flag, EPICS will check the HIUPDATE screen to see if a premium limit exists for the court order. When contacting the employer, EPICS will ask if they offer any health insurance plan within the premium limit. If the employer does not, EPICS will not send the NMSN and EPICS will narrate the findings.</p>\n<p>Until a new code is developed for this specific scenario, EPICS will enter the current code of “X” in the ENR STAT field on the MEDSUM2 screen to stop the NMSN from issuing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>X – Medical support enforcement forms not sent because this employer does not offer health insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The procedures for determining accessibility have not changed. Accessibility, as well as reasonable cost, is determined at the time of the establishment or modification action, not at the time of enforcement. EPICS will not determine accessibility before sending the NMSN.</p>\n<p>4. <b>Will review need to be done when the NMSN is returned to see if the premium amount provided on the NMSN by the employer exceeds the limitations on the HIUPDATE exceptions, or will the medical information just get added?</b></p>\n<p>The COURT ORDER PREMIUM LIMIT field (the COURT ORDER PREMIUM LIMIT field was replaced by the REAS COST and <i>TOTAL COST</i> fields) on the HIUPDATE screen is not a new field. EPICS will follow their current practice of reviewing this field when an NMSN is returned. If the employer does not implement the order as provided by CSRU, it will be the payor’s responsibility to challenge it.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> EPICS will have no way of knowing if the employer truly didn’t follow the NMSN as written or if the employee asked the employer to enroll a child in a higher priced health insurance plan.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>How Bankruptcy Affects Medical Enforcement</h4>\n<p>When a payor files bankruptcy, you must complete the BANKRPTCY & CHAPTR field on the PAYOR screen.

This includes coverage provided by the payor, payee and private coverage.</p>\n<p>CSRU may become aware that a payor has enrolled the child(ren) in the payor’s employer health insurance coverage without the issuance of an NMSN. The medical screens are updated with this information.</p>\n<p>Without receipt of an NMSN:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The plan administrator is not advised to provide policy information to the payee.</li>\n<li>The employer is not aware that the health insurance enrollment is court ordered and the child(ren) must remain enrolled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For these reasons, it is essential that an NMSN be sent to the employer even when the payor is ordered to provide health insurance and the children are already enrolled.</p>\n<p>Examples of events that require the manual generation of an NMSN <span style=\"color: red;\">are listed below. The examples only apply when Iowa is enforcing.  If Iowa is not enforcing, do not manually generate the NMSN.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payor’s health insurance information is provided during establishment or modification action <b>prior</b> to the entry of a court order including medical enforcement.\n<ul>\n<li>Update ICAR medical screens with payor health insurance information.<br />\nOnce the order is obtained for medical enforcement, manually generate the NMSN.<br />\nEnter the EPICS address for the employer’s return of the document.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Payor ordered to provide health insurance calls with new employment and health insurance information.\n<ul>\n<li>Add the employer to ICAR.</li>\n<li>Allow MEDSUM to run overnight.</li>\n<li>Check the case two days later to ensure the NMSN was sent to the employer.</li>\n<li>Update ICAR medical screens with employment related health insurance information if sufficient information was obtained from the payor to accurately update ICAR. Example: payor provided copy of employment related health insurance card. If only partial information was provided, a call to the employer may be necessary to ensure timely update of the medical screens.</li>\n<li>Upon return of the NMSN, EPICS will compare the information on the NMSN to the information on the medical screens for accuracy.</li>\n<br />\n<p>--OR--</p>\n<li>Add the employer to ICAR and update the medical screens with the payor’s health insurance information.<br />\nManually generate the NMSN. Enter the EPICS address for the employer’s return of the document.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Payee asks CSRU to enforce health insurance available to the payor through an employer. The payee is currently providing health insurance and the payor is court ordered to provide health insurance for the children.\n<ul>\n<li>Update ICAR medical screens with payee health insurance information.</li>\n<li>Upon payee request for enforcement, manually generate the NMSN. Set calendar flag to monitor for return of the NMSN.</li>\n<li>Document payee request on the MEDINFO screen.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Employer or Plan Administrator requests duplicate or updated copy of NMSN.\n<ul>\n<li>Check the MEDSUM2 screen. If the hipot field is “1,” use the ONLINE FORM or the REPRINT field.</li>\n<li>If the hipot field is not a “1,” manually generate the NMSN.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Premium limit for enrolling a child in a health benefit plan changes due to the modification of an existing order. This includes a change from no premium limit to a premium limit, a change from one premium limit to another premium limit, or a change from an existing premium limit to no premium limit.\n<ul>\n<li>Update the reas cost or total cost fields on the HIUPDATE screen to reflect the current premium limit. The premium limit must be in the decretal part of the order. You will enter this premium limit when you manually generate the NMSN.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Manually generate the NMSN to the employer by entering FORMS in the NEXT SCREEN function on ICAR. Have the following information available when manually generating the NMSN (470-3818) and the Employer Medical Support Information form (470-2743):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case number.</li>\n<li>Payor’s name, address, and SSN.</li>\n<li>Payee’s name and address (If a DRI or FVI display on the PAYEE or CHILD screen, use EPICS’ address instead of payee’s address.)</li>\n<li>Names, SSNs and DOB of the children.</li>\n<li>Employer name, address and FEIN (Use the medical mailing address from VEMPLOY2 if listed. From the EMPVER screen, you can use F14 to get to the VEMPLOY screen, and then use F11 to get to the VEMPLOY2 screen.)</li>\n<li>Court order number, order date, county of filing.</li>\n<li>EPICS mailing address—501 Sycamore Ste 500, Waterloo, IA 50703-4651.</li>\n<li>The current premium limit displaying in the reas cost or total cost fields on the HIUPDATE screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Send the NMSN to the employer.

While the statute provides a clear indication that the State may not retain more support than is necessary for the reimbursement of that assistance, the statute is silent as to whom receives any overage associated with these cases.</p>\n<p>To clarify this situation Policy staff and Unit Attorneys have developed a process to re-direct the support on caretaker cases from the current payee for the impacted order to the caretaker. This PD clarifies the ownership of any overage that may be associated with the caretaker case.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding this PD, please contact any member of the Distribution team through normal channels.</p>\n<p>Hard copies of the signed document will be distributed accordingly.

There are two sets of forms to use for this re-direction process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forms 470-4543 (motion) and 470-4544 (order) when a single child is covered by the order and is now with a caretaker.</li>\n<li>Forms 470-4545 (motion) and 470-4546 (order) when multiple children are covered by the order and are now with a caretaker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: On the multiple child forms you can indicate whether all of the children are with the caretaker or some of the children are with the caretaker.</p>\n<p>You can generate the forms using a new field CT M/O and ATTY on the PAYEE2 screen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To generate forms 470-4543 and 470-4544, enter S and the worker ID for the attorney who will sign the motion in the field. Once you modify the screen, ICAR presents the forms to you in order.</li>\n<li>To generate forms 470-4545 and 470-4546, enter M and the worker ID for the attorney who will sign the motion in the field. Once you modify the screen, ICAR presents the forms to you in order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PD attached to this e-mail provides additional information in the use of these forms.</p>\n<p>Thanks to attorneys Joaquin Jones, Jade Haverman, Michael Parker, and SRS Jim Cruchelow for their assistance in the development of these forms. If you have any questions regarding these forms, please contact any member of the Distribution Team through normal channels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://intra/csruhandbooks/HANDBOOKS/Caretaker/Contents/InfoSentToStaff/PD%2008-04%20Caretaker%20Re-directions.doc\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://stcsruportalcli.blob.core.windows.net/csruportalwpcontent/2020/04/word.png\"> <b>PD 08-04 Caretaker Re-directions</b></a></p>\n<p>Terri Pollard<br />\nCentral Office<br />\n515-242-6096</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4>Entering Court Order Numbers</h4>\n<p>-----Original Message-----<br />\nFrom: Granberg, Siri<br />\nSent: Wednesday, July 11, 2007 9:26 AM<br />\nTo: CSRU Policy Information<br />\nSubject: Entering Court Order Numbers<br />\nImportance: High</p>\n<p>Please share with all appropriate staff.</p>\n<p>As we implement the caretaker project, please remember to enter court order numbers correctly on the COURTORD screen.</p>\n<p>When entering court order numbers into the ICIS C.O. NUMBER field on the COURTORD screen, remember to enter 4 letters and 6 numbers. If the document you have doesn\'t have 4 letters and 6 numbers, please:<br />\nCheck the ICIS system for the full court order number.<br />\nReview the Case Set Appendix for a list of letter combinations for the county of filing.<br />\nEnter zeros in front of the numbers you do have until you reach 6 digits.</p>\n<p>For example, the document you have shows CD1234 as the court order number for Jackson County. The Case Set Up Appendix shows the letter combination for Jackson County is CVCD, and you know you need 6 numbers. Enter CVCD001234 in the ICIS C.O. NUMBER field.</p>\n<p>Entering all 4 characters and all 6 numbers in the ICIS C.O. NUMBER field helps ICAR match with the ICIS system. In the past, duplicate cases loaded to ICAR. When an ICIS case comes through the State Case Registry, a program compares the court order number from ICIS system to ICAR to see if the case exists. When the court order numbers don\'t match exactly, ICAR thinks it is a new number, and builds a new case.</p>\n<p>When you work a case, we recommend that you review the court order number to see if the format is right; if not, please update the screen. Remember to update the COURT ORDER NUMBER field for all Iowa orders when you see a different format on the ICIS system for the same court docket number. This allows the ICIS C.O. NUMBER field and the COURT ORDER NUMBER field to match. If you are filing an out-of-state order for enforcement, keep the other state\'s court docket number in the COURT ORDER NUMBER field and enter the Iowa ICIS number in the ICIS C.O. NUMBER field and the Iowa county FIPS in the REG/FILE COUNTY FIPS field.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding this case set up information, please contact Siri Granberg.</p>\n<p>Siri Granberg<br />\n515-281-4290</p>\";i:1587396516344;s:1486:\"<p><b>What do you do when you have multiple cases for the same child and payor and the order is from another state?

Since this is an administrative process, the Child Support Recovery Unit (Unit) has the authority to pursue this type of enforcement action without the need for an additional court order. The obligor or joint owner may challenge the administrative levy process administratively through the Unit as well as through the district court.\n\nIowa Code Chapter 252I authorizes the Unit to use an administrative levy to collect delinquent support payments by executing, attaching or placing levies against obligors’ accounts maintained in Iowa financial institutions and in out-of-state financial institutions accepting direct levies from Iowa. Using the interstate referral process, the Unit may also place levies against obligors’ accounts maintained in out-of-state financial institutions not accepting direct levies.\n\nAsset information may be received through several sources, the primary source being the automated financial institution data-match (FIDM). The FIDM process has two parts:\n<ul>\n \t<li>In-state (ISFIDM) matching provides account information from financial institutions within the state of Iowa.</li>\n \t<li>Multi-state (MSFIDM) matching provides account information from financial institutions throughout the United States and its territories.</li>\n</ul>\nAsset information may also be received through contact with the obligee or other interested third party.\n\nThe administrative levy process is semi-centralized.

Challenges allow the obligor/joint owner due process in resolving issues related to the administrative levy placed against the obligor’s/joint owner’s assets.\nThere are two types of challenges to the administrative levy process: administrative and district court. The Unit handles the administrative challenge internally. The outcome of this challenge is decided administratively without court involvement. If the party wishes to challenge the decision of the administrative challenge, the party may file a district court challenge. The district court decides the outcome of this challenge.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Who can submit a challenge?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(1); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b>\n\nA challenge to the administrative levy process must be submitted by or on behalf of the obligor or joint owner. A joint owner is considered to be any person having a direct interest in the asset being levied, whether or not the person received notice of the administrative levy action by the Unit. If the joint owner is a minor, an adult having a direct interest in the minor’s welfare may submit the challenge on the minor’s behalf.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>What is considered a “written” challenge?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(2); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b>\n\nIowa Code requires all challenges to the administrative levy process to be in <b>writing</b>. Consider <b>any</b> written communication from the obligor or joint owner received by the Unit after the issuance of the Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor or Administrative Levy Notice to Joint Owner as a challenge. “Written communication” includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Letter or note.</li>\n \t<li>E-mail.</li>\n \t<li>Fax.</li>\n</ul>\nIf the obligor/joint owner states over the telephone or in person his or her intent to challenge the administrative levy and does <b>not</b> provide a written document to that effect within the specified timeframe, then no challenge is received.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>What are the timeframes for submitting a challenge?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(2); 441 IAC 98.97(252I)</b>\n\nBoth the administrative and district court challenges must be submitted <b>in writing</b> and <b>received</b> by the Unit within 10 working days of a previous action by the Unit (described below). Iowa Code section 252I.1(10) defines “working days” as “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, but excluding the holidays specified in section 1C.2, subsections 1 through 9.”\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Administrative Challenges</b>\n\n<b>All administrative challenges must be in writing and physically received by the Unit within 10 working days of the date on form 470-3338, Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor, or form 470-3207, Administrative Levy Notice to Joint Owner.</b>\n\nTo determine whether the administrative challenge is timely:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Review the date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field on the ADMLEVY screen.</li>\n \t<li>Review the case narratives for the date the notices were mailed (in case the notices were mailed on a date other than the date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field).</li>\n \t<li>Count 10 days from the day <b>after</b> the date on the form or the date of mailing, whichever is most recent.\n<b>Example:</b> The date displayed in the levy notice to obligor proof of service sent field indicates that you mailed the Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor on Thursday, August 11th. Start counting from Friday, August 12th. The 13th, 14th, 20th and 21st are <b>weekend</b> days and are not counted in the 10 days. To be considered timely, you must receive the challenge on or before August 26th.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Information for challenges to the Administrative Levy process</b>\n\nIf a payor has multiple ICAR cases, all of the payor’s case numbers display on form 470-3338, <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i> and form 470-3208, <i>Notice of Decision Regarding Admin Levy Challenge</i>, <b>even when a case did not qualify for a levy</b>. Sometimes FIs use the case numbers from these forms when sending in the levy payment, causing money to distribute to a case in error.\n\nIf you receive a challenge to an administrative levy (from either the payor or the joint owner) and the payor has multiple ICAR cases, you need to verify which cases qualified for that levy. To verify which of the payor’s cases qualified for that levy, you can:\n<ol type=\"a\">\n \t<li>Use Global 360 to review form 470-3189, <i>Administrative Levy Notice to Financial Institution</i> or form 470-3188, <i>Administrative Levy Notice to Obligor</i>. Both of these forms should display the case numbers that qualified for this levy.</li>\n</ol>\nMake sure you view the forms with the correct FI and the correct date of the levy.\n\n<b>OR</b>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n \t<li>Review the narratives on <b>all</b> of the payor’s ICAR cases to locate the narrative (LEVY 17: CASE HAS MET ADMINISTRATIVE LEVY CRITERIA). This narrative must be dated closely before this FI was added to the case. If a case does not have the narrative (LEVY 17) before this FI was added to the case, the case did not qualify to be levied at that time.</li>\n \t<li>When you have verified which of the payor’s cases qualified for this levy, complete the CHALLENGE FILED DATE field and the corresponding TYPE field (on the ADMINISTRATIVE LEVY screen). ICAR will begin generating the <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i>.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n \t<li>When the form is generating, remove the case numbers that did not qualify for this levy from the ICAR CASE NUMBERS FIELD ON THE FORM VIEW screen. After you edit the case number information, press F3 to update the changes.</li>\n \t<li>Then print the form.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that only the case numbers which qualified for this levy are on the form.</li>\n \t<li>Do this for each copy of the <i>Notice of Challenge to Admin Levy</i> (for the FI, the payor, and the joint owner).</li>\n \t<li>Image the copies.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n \t<li>After you have held the administrative levy challenge and have entered the information in the N.O.D. TO OBLIGOR &amp; FI (R/U): field (on the ADMINISTRATIVE LEVY screen), ICAR will begin generating the <i>Notice of Decision Regarding Admin Levy Challenge</i>.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n \t<li>When the form is generating, remove the case numbers that did not qualify for this levy from the CASE NUMBERS FIELD on the FORM VIEW screen.

The challenging party has a right to a review of the facts of the case prior to you determining the outcome of the challenge and sending the Notice of Decision Regarding Administrative Levy Challenge.\n\n<b>When you receive a challenge that is not timely, still review the basis for the challenge to determine whether the Unit has made a mistake of fact. This is especially important when the challenge involves jointly held assets.</b>\n\nWhen you receive an <b>un-timely</b> challenge that involves jointly held assets, treat the challenge as if it were timely and proceed with contacting the challenging party to schedule a conference to review the facts of the case.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>What is a “Mistake of Fact”?</b>\n\n<b>Legal reference: Iowa Code section 252I.8(3); 441 IAC 98.97(1)</b>\n\nThe determination of whether you uphold or release an administrative levy is based on the challenging party’s ability to prove the Unit made a “mistake of fact” regarding the levy. The definition of “mistake of fact” is based in <b>law</b>.\n\nAs defined in Iowa Code and the Iowa Administrative Code, a “<b>mistake of fact</b>” is a mistake <b><i>including but not limited to</i></b>, a mistake in the identity of the obligor or a mistake in the amount of delinquent support due; policy further extends this definition to a mistake in the amount of the asset or a mistake in the information reported to the Unit by the financial institution. The language “<b>including but not limited to</b>” means that <b>any</b> reason pertaining directly to the levy, above-stated or otherwise, the party provides as the basis for the challenge <b>must</b> be accepted as a <b>mistake of fact</b>. Until disproved by the Unit, you <b>cannot</b> deny a challenge because the challenge does not meet one of the specific above-named criteria.\n\nWhen you receive a challenge (whether or not it is timely) from a joint owner or involving a jointly-held asset, <b>accept the challenge</b> and ask the challenging party to provide verification of whose funds are deposited in the account. This information helps you determine whether to uphold or release the levy.\n\nSupervisory approval is required to release an administrative levy for any reason other than a mistake in identity, incorrect delinquency, or overpayment of balance.

During the conference, the obligor states the daughter is saving her babysitting money to buy a new bicycle. Request the obligor provide proof of the deposits/withdrawals.\n<b>Outcome:</b>\nIf the only deposits/withdrawals are those made by or on behalf of the daughter, <b>release</b> the levy.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n \t<li>You receive an un-timely challenge from the joint owner. The joint owner is the obligor’s elderly mother. The challenge states that the obligor’s mother placed the obligor’s name on her account for when she passes away. The joint owner has cited a <b>mistake of fact</b>, as the account does not really belong to the obligor.<b>Action:</b>\nSchedule a conference with the joint owner to discuss the issues related to the levy. During the conference, the obligor’s mother states the obligor has no knowledge of the account and has not made any deposits to or withdrawals from the account.

If possible, try to resolve the challenge issues pro-actively and avoid the necessity of a conference. If the obligor/joint owner calls you ensure that the case selection criteria are correct and that the asset can be levied.\n\nThe challenge process begins when the obligor/joint owner <b>actually submits a written challenge</b>. Do not notify the financial institution of a challenge after a telephone conversation or a walk-in conversation unless the person actually submits a <b>written</b> challenge to the Unit. If the person takes the written challenge with him/her, the challenge is not actually submitted to the Unit.\n\n<b>Example:</b>\n\nThe obligor requests a telephone call from you. You call the obligor and answer the obligor’s questions about the administrative levy. Specifically remind the obligor that any challenge has to be in writing and received by the Unit within 10 working days. Narrate this reminder and do <b>not</b> generate form 470-3338, <i>Notice of Challenge to Administrative Levy</i>, to the financial institution, or form 470-3208, <i>Notice of Decision Regarding Administrative Levy Challenge</i>, to the obligor/joint owner.\";i:1582231562545;s:2706:\"<b>Questions from the Obligor/Joint Owner</b>\n\n<b>Q.</b> What authority do you have to levy my accounts?\n<b>A.</b> Iowa Code, <a href=\"http://search.legis.state.ia.us/nxt/gateway.dll/ic?f=templates&amp;fn=default.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chapter 252I</a>.\n\n<b>Q.</b> How did you find out where I bank?\n<b>A.</b> Through automated sources or other confidential sources.\n\n<b>Q.</b> If I change financial institutions, will you be able to find my account?\n<b>A.</b> Yes.\n\n<b>Q.</b> Do you care if I need the money for living expenses?\n<b>A.</b> We will only take up to 50% of the account.

However, when the obligor makes a REG payment in direct response to an administrative levy action, it is important to count the payment as a levy or \"LVY\" payment. This is because the funds available to pay the Iowa financial institutions for the FIDM asset information are based on the state\'s share of the PA levy collections.\n\nWhen you receive a REG payment from an obligor as a result of administrative levy notification, mark the payment as an <i>administrative levy</i> payment and forward it to CSC.

If a release or revision is needed, the TSP Levy Team will issue one with the forms that are specific to the TSP levies.</p>\n<p><b>Q.</b> What is the timeline for the TSP Levy process?<br />\n<b>A.</b> The TSP processes a levy in four steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As soon as possible after TSP receives an order to withhold, the payor’s account will be “frozen.”</li>\n<li>TSP will then evaluate the documents to ensure completeness. If it is not complete, TSP will send a written request for complete documents. TSP will remove the freeze if a complete copy is not received within 30 days of TSP’s written request.</li>\n<li>When TSP receives a complete order to withhold, TSP will evaluate it to determine whether it is a qualifying levy.</li>\n<li>TSP will mail a decision letter to the payor and provide a copy to all other parties having an interest in the action. The decision letter will describe the effect the levy will have on the payor’s account and state when the freeze will be removed from the account. If the levy does not qualify, the decision letter will explain why. If the levy qualifies and requires a payment from TSP, the letter will also explain how the payment amount will be calculated and when the payment will be made.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The timeframes in a TSP levy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After TSP receives the levy form, it may take <span style=\"color: red;\">30-60 days</span> to review it and generate a decision letter. (See steps 1-4 above.)</li>\n<li>The payment date will generally be set 30 calendar days from the date of the decision letter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a TSP account was frozen upon receipt of an order to withhold, the freeze will be removed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>upon receipt of an order removing the freeze,</li>\n<li>after payment pursuant to a qualifying order to deliver, or</li>\n<li>as soon as possible, after TSP informs the parties in writing that the document is not a qualifying levy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Q.</b> Will CSRU levy a TSP account more than once?<br />\n<b>A.</b> The TSP Levy Team will generate and process a levy for any ICAR case that meets the administrative levy criteria. However, because a levy on a TSP account can take a minimum of <span style=\"color: red;\">3 – 4 months</span> to complete, there may be a circumstance where the TSP account has re-matched the same ICAR case before CSRU has received the payment from the previous TSP levy.</p>\n<p>The TSP Levy Team reviews the ICAR case for previous TSP levies. If a levy was previously generated and processed on a TSP account, payments will be reviewed to see if CSRU has received the payment from the previous TSP levy. If the TSP levy payment has applied to the ICAR case, the TSP Levy Team will generate and process a new levy. If no TSP levy payment has applied, the TSP Levy Team will not fax a new levy to TSP at this time and will monitor the case for the incoming TSP levy payment. After the TSP levy payment applies, if the case still meets the criteria for an administrative levy, a new levy will be generated and processed.</p>\";i:1582231619231;s:3062:\"<p>Identification of an asset is the very first step in the administrative levy process.
